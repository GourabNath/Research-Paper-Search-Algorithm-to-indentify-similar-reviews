2,"one plus 6 is extremely worth for it's price and moreover in Amazon sale it's even beyond that. 35k for this phone is worth buying but in Amazon sale it costs me 27k. it's just mind blowing deal for me.

A fast device with perfect photo clicking quality. Definitely the best phone to buy","mind,quality,phone,price,sale,deal,amazon,photo,device"

25,"Performance is good, but has some issues. The mobile Internet on the phone stops working and required a restart almost 3 times a day.
The people at the sales outlet at Seawoods Grand Central Mall are not even willing to talk to you. They ask you to go to the service centre. They say that they don't know technical stuff, only information for selling. They perhaps are worried about customers getting influenced by the visit of a customer who has run into problems. Instead of reassuring the customer, they keep repeating -  'Go to the Service Centre. We don't know anything.'. This is is so so sad.
The people at the service centre say that it required a factory reset as there is some OS Corruption. This is strange. Additionally, they do not even have an option to help you with your data backup.
The only good thing they had at the service centre was good coffee. The place is worth a visit only if you want some good coffee. Service is not their forte. Thank you.","restart,visit,issue,reset,person,stop,internet,performance,phone,corruption,the,coffee,option,service,forte,outlet,seawood,information,centre,datum,problem,place,time,sale,stuff,day,factory,mall,anyth,customer"

34,Yet another masterpiece from one plus. Been using from 6 months now. Handled it very rough. Installed many apps and games. Using it heavily and havent noticed little lag or any problem so ever. No lag. Does justice to the caption. Speed you need. Had issues with amazon delivery. My first order was lost in transit. Then reordered from prime now with 2 hour delivery.

Camera is good but videos below full HD seem to be of lower quality than they should be. Slow me video is patchy and bokeh is below average. As a new device battery life is average. I used to have a Nexus 5 and despite the ""huge"" upgrade I don't see a huge performance boost. This device even crashed several times while playing simple games. Sound quality however is one of the best any loud speaker, even if not the loudest available, is still good.","quality,print,finger,performance,bokeh,boost,camera,sound,face,game,device,upgrade,product,someth,battery,video,time,speaker,life,patchy,nexu,recognition,foot"

1. Exteremley fast user interface and navigation. No hanging, heating up while using multiple apps.
2. Quick updates from OnePlus. (Pie, Security patches etc)

4. All heavy games such as Pubg, Asphalt 9 run in high resolution.
5. Sound quality is good but struggles a bit for loudness especially if you have high impedance Earphones.
Cons:
1. No memory card slot
2. No stereo speakers
3. No IP certified for water resistance
4. Battery life is ok. Though charging is fast.

940,"First of all thanks to you @Amazon  for such blaze fast delivery, now about the phone it's truely gem of device.
I got it in great Indian sale in which it was priced @Rs 35000 or so don't remember exactly but eventually it came down to 33k with SBI debit card.
But there still is a catch cuz it came with an year screen replacement warranty although it's 3rd party subscription but who cares untill you're getting paid to crack your own screen (within the insurance period). But don't take it seriously guys always use a back cover.
Now about the device this is really a beast of a phone ..
Powerapcked performance with a SD 845 and 8gb of Ram as well as 128gb of memory.
No so ever lag whole playing PUBG in ultra HD and fram rate set to highest. Thumbs up for that.
Camera is quiet good as well as ...
But don't take it otherwise one might still struggle to take good portraits with bokah effect.
If you're familiar with photography (i.e. are able to use and understand Manual mode then u already are a winner).
Note - for pro user ( the iso bar doesn't start from 50, it starts from 100) .
Speaker is loud enough and good. But not that gr8
UI - who doesn't love stock rom if u r one of em then guy u have a serious problem 😅 . P.s. just kidding. But stock rom makes it bloatfree and smooth as butter.
Note. Would have liked a custom music player with advanced settings such as toggles, bass controller,etc..
If u are an audiophile then you will get adequate quality of sound through earpiece but it's not as much as great as tgat found on LG devices (p.s. upgrading from lg g6).
Design - Cool ergonomic design with a slight curved at back making it easy to hold. The body is beautiful AF. P.s. got a mirror black variant but is smudge prone would recommend to keep a wipe cloth always with you if you really are planning to buy this to flaunt otherwise a pre provided case would do.
We get a charger, a case , and an ejector (sim card) along with ghe handset.
Charging is awsome as usual with 1+ devices and can charge device quickly even though one is playing pubg on full brightness and highest setting. Hats off to 1+ for that.
So signing off with that remark.
If u liked it pleas upvote it

Just one PUBG game and the battery falls down by almost 20%. So it is annoying during travelling. But luckily the dash charger provided with the phone charges the phone with the same rate as it discharges. You can get upto 25-30% in just 20 minutes. So it is not a problem until we have a plug point to plug in the dash charger. But if you need to charge the phone using some power bank, it takes some considerable time to get charged.....","charger,bank,juice,rate,phone,power,price,battery,pubg,minut,charge,range,point,problem,con,time,plug,game,dash,usage"

Camera- The image quality with the stock camera app is decent. However, the Gcam mod has done wonders which can be installed without root.
Speakers- People say that it's sound is tinny, but in my opinion, they perform pretty good and can handle loud background noise easily.
OxygenOS- The best thing of this phone. The light and bloatfree ui has made me fall in love with the software.
Battery- It was really a beast when the phone was on oreo. Whereas, in pie, it has degraded a bit but it can easily cut through the day with 2 charges (while playing heavy games like PUBG in my case).
Performance- No words. It handles everything you throw at it easily.
Looks- Gorgeous
Screen- It's a massive screen. Some people may find it difficult to handle but i think due to it's tall form factor and thin bezel design, it's not difficult to hold on. Moreover, the screen quality is really nice.
The last and the best. Dash charger. It can charge upto 65% in just half an hour.

If you ask why go for the 6 when the 6t was just a week away. I'ld say that the internals are exactly the same. So there is no upgradation on the performance stand point. The cameras are exactly the same, you do have a headphone jack which is my personal preference and also I prefer the normal fingerprint sensor that is on the back instead of the optical under the screen. The screen on the 6t is bigger by 0.1"" so that's not like a huge difference. On the notch front i'ld have preferred the tear drop shape but basically can't complain when you get such a good deal.
So decided to buy this one and got a super super super sweet deal at Amazon. Delivery was fast.
The device that we order in India is the one that's assembled in India at the Oppo Factory.","upgradation,optical,relase,point,difference,notch,week,stand,tear,performance,one,jack,back,deal,camera,amazon,shape,device,preference,headphone,india,variant,drop,internal,screen,oppo,delivery,sensor,front,factory,fingerprint"

After my phone crashed i called up the support toll free number and th rep Deepak was more keen to get off the phone. Told me that company never promised easy or good support when i mentioned their lack of support centers in Bangalore and poor quality of product. He told me only way I can register a complaint was thru a android phone which I pointed out one plus 5t has crashed within 10 months. Finally he me I could raise a complaint from my laptop. Their web site for registering complaint is defective and does Not work. Perhaps that's deliberate to avoid complaint registration.  It forces one to enter location from drop down and does not go beyond that.

2128,"Everything is good about this phone, except that the good features that were there in Moto G4 are missing. I'm not talking about the brand specific features. I'm more worried about the options and settings that were available there.
1. Now There is no option to independently setup notifications per app in lock screen when phone is locked and pull down tab when phone is unlocked. In summary, lock screen is cluttered with notifications from preferred apps, while there no space for music apps for control. I gave feedback about it, but there is no response from OnePlus
2. The apps list is now tiled vertically side by side with no option available to set it like one on top of the other, like it was before. The navigation with earlier approach was very fast. Now it takes longer time to navigate through app one by one
3. Volume control is not good. It takes you to whole new page. Any video playing at that time would stop. This happens especially when I am playing video and want to turn off alarm sound or reduce ringing volume.
4. Bluetooth does not connect to already known device automatically. It it seems to take long time.
5. The gestures are not sensitive enough to work first time. It needs at least two attempts to open app through gestures on locked screen
There are many more, but this is all for now.","bluetooth,music,side,gesture,tab,lock,volume,feature,response,phone,space,top,navigation,attempt,notification,page,sound,option,device,app,summary,feedback,setting,video,moto,time,screen,oneplu,everythe,alarm,play,approach,list,brand,control"

Sleeping time was not set initially. I did the same and battery draining time has reduced. I have contacted Amazon and they had offered the service of a home Service Expert. He had come and suggested a couple of other setting changes as well which has increased the battery usage time. Now I am getting a whole day with heavy usage.  Camera is just awesome. No over heating issue. Fast charger is an additional advantage. When the battery problem had started i was bit repentant that I should have waited for 1+6T. Now I am fine as battery is giving reasonable coverage throughout the day.,"expert,issue,coverage,charger,heat,thank,camera,amazon,service,couple,advantage,product,offer,change,battery,problem,time,usage,mobile,everythe,drain,dusshera,home,day"

2477,"Bought this phone about a month ago in just 27999 INR (with 1000 INR Amazon pay cash back) and this is my opinion after using it for a month:
I wanted the best hardware configuration for my device which eliminate all the slowness possibilities for Android device.
About hardware:
The outer case is premium in feel and touch. The display ratio to body is perfect. You won't notice any borders as such on all corners. Display is pretty vivid and touch is suoer responsive. The device feels sturdy enough to handle small and medium impacts. The side buttons are easy to operate and does not feel too soft or too notchy either.
Camera:
Camera is not super but definitely a good one. There are lot of ootions in Pro mode just like we get un DSLR. You can set everything custom as per your requirement like focus, aperture, ISO, shutter soeed etc which eill results in very customisable photos.
Sound and Microphone:
Siund at loudspeakers are perfect and audible even in crowded places. Earpiece for calling fullfills the expectatios. Since Oneplus does not provide the headphones in box, you can use any 3.5 mm headphones.
Battery backup:
I simply love the dash charging technology of this device. It charges upto 50 percent of battery just in 10 minutes. Overall battery backup is upto the mark. A single charge will be sufficient with heavy internet usage for a day.
Overall performance:
Yes. This device does heats up a bit when you play any high end games for approx 30 minutes which is very natural as you are using all it's components at extereme levels for better gaming experience. But again, even the battery performance is suoerb for gaming too.
Few areas for improvement:
There are some areas in terms of user UI experience which Oneplus needs to improve a bit. Like other Android devices, this also keeps a lot of garbage files on you ROM which you need to clear time to time. Of course, it won't cause any slowness but it will definitely occupy a space on your ROM.
FINAL verdict:
I woukd definitely recommend this device because even other high end Android devices does not cone uo with such configuration at this orice tag. Snapdragon 845 with 640 GPU packed with 6/8 GB RAM is an astonishing combination in this price bucket.","suoerb,button,slowne,improvement,back,minut,opinion,month,shutter,garbage,devic,corner,suoer,soee,place,bite,everythe,oneplu,ootion,day,rom,technology,eill,premium,side,box,file,microphone,extereme,internet,touch,case,hardware,gpu,charge,course,camera,amazon,sound,device,ratio,user,body,ram,time,siund,bucket,tag,inr,price,orice,custom,iso,focu,backup,expectatio,heat,performance,phone,earpiece,space,mark,lot,border,display,aperture,configuration,impact,term,fullfill,photo,combination,experience,verdict,game,possibilitie,headphone,requirement,feel,dslr,mode,battery,area,component,dash,usage,level,end,loudspeaker,percent,cash,snapdragon"

2. CHARGER : Its superb , excellent ,mind blowing charge rapidly .
3. SCREEN TOUCH is overall good and buttery.
CONS :
CAMERA : Nice on paper but not on reality , pictures are not crisp sometime have oil paint effect , I think main problem is with image processing. So advise everyone no to update to os. 9.0.2 .
BATTERY BACKUP : It easily last for 1 and half day *if you dont play games as I dont play games. Otherwise for heavy user hardly 3-3.5 hours.
Sound Quality : sometime shrill at full volume.
Camera Bumper : Get scratches , so dont like it.
Now I can say this phone doesnt deserve price tag of 35k , I bought @27k so fine.

Pros: Awesome software experience with minimal but useful customisation and regular updates which will make it better in the coming days.
Ram management is also very good as I bought 8 gb variant it can hold many application in memory for longer period
Display is bright and vivid I didn't bother about quad hd resolution full hd+ works fine for me
Build quality is very good, ultrafast fingerprint scanner and faceunlock
Dash charge is superb
Both front camera and back camera is excellent in good light and medium light condition & back camera video output is excellent and for fun there is a slomo feature @720p 480fps
Google camera. Port is working with out root
Developer develop a lot of custom ROM for this device so it is quite future proof
Cons: the bottomfiring speaker output is below average it is well balanced but lacking in volume
Both front and back camera gives an oil painting effect in human subjects in low light condition
Headphone output is very flat not to my liking
After pie update battery drainage increases a lot hope it will fixed in future update.

Everything seems amazingly perfect and I have used so many mobiles so far in lifting the brand's like Nokia, Samsung, Nexus, Motorola but this time the experience is amazingly awesome altogether.
Didn't find anything bad or worst about the mobile (OnePlus 6) so far, so giving it a rating of 4stars as nothing in this world is perfect and hence they launched even OnePlus 6t.
One must buy this mobile if you are a hardcore fan of videos, music, photography and games and faster and faster performance of the mobile without giving you any troubles as such.","music,motorola,performance,world,experience,month,nokia,rat,game,trouble,purchase,brand,photography,video,time,review,usage,mobile,oneplu,everythe,nexu,fan,nothe,anyth"

2) Sound quality via earphone is awesome with thirdparty music app, call quality is also good no issue faced but loud speaker quality is above average they could have given Stereo speaker

Overall rating: 8/10
Camera: 7/10 Very good (in good lighting condition), bokeh is also Ok but not the best. But given the price, it is one of the best.
Average (in low light). You will find graininess in the pictures.
Processor/Ram: 10/10 The phone is exceptionally fast. No lag at all. Some apps may get stuck occasionally but after some updates issue resolved.
Heating: I have played pubg, recorded videos, no heating issues so far.
Build quality: 9/10 build quality is good, gives a premium feel.
Dash charge: 10/10 That's one of the highlights, it gets charged very quickly with the USB C type l
Port. But it will charge quickly only through the adapter and cable supplied along with phone.
Face unlock/ fingerprint: 9/10 Almost perfect
Sound: 8/10 It has a decent sound output, with single speaker at the bottom, although not the best.
Cons:
Phone battery has started draining quite frequently after a recent update. It need to be resolved in further update.
Low light camera is just average. Newly introduced nightscape mode has  made some improvements but still it can be better. Also have to focus well and stay still to get a clear shot. Some times it takes tine to focus as well.
Overall It is a good choice in this price range. But If you already own one plus 5T, I don't think it is good to buy this.
 If you are looking for performance with a decent camera with dash charging, go for it without any doubt.","lag,quality,condition,picture,premium,pubg,adapter,issue,shoot,highlight,doubt,port,improvement,performance,heat,phone,bokeh,charge,month,range,type,camera,rat,sound,update,con,app,grainine,nightscape,feel,mode,battery,bottom,video,light,ram,time,choice,output,speaker,dash,cable,price,processor,usb,tine,build,fingerprint"

3383,The one phone you wish you had,phone
3384,"Based on my experience so far:
Pros
1. Speed - there's simply no match for it, you can open any number of apps simultaneously and it won't crash with 8 gigs of ram and Snapdragon 845 processor.
2. Display - looks good and the phone looks like a premium handset.
3. Price - got it at 35k (at a discount of 5k) when the last few pieces were available. Considering that 6T with minor upgrade for battery is priced at 42k (8 GB + 128 GB), this is value for money.
4. It's got a 3.5 mm jack - absent in 6T. Say what you want - 3.5 mm jack is currently a must for sound quality with good headphones and convenience (consider the inconvenience of carrying  a USB C adaptor etc.)
5. Good battery life - should easily get you thru the day even after heavy usage. Charging is also quick with the dash charge technology.
Cons:-
1. Sound quality on mono bottom firing speaker and earpiece is not on par with stereo speakers of my previous budget handset - Moto G4 plus.
2. No SD card - but this is compensated adequately if you have 128 gigs of internal storage
3. It's a glass back - need to handle delicately - can't imagine dropping it even with a back silicon cover.","spee,card,technology,quality,handset,gla,budget,storage,gig,piece,phone,earpiece,must,adaptor,charge,experience,jack,back,look,silicon,sound,number,money,upgrade,app,value,headphone,pro,absent,battery,cover,ram,moto,display,match,speaker,life,usage,dash,inconvenience,convenience,nee,processor,price,par,snapdragon,day,usb,discount,fire"

I use my phone in my breaks and mostly after reaching home. Hardware is still running good after incremental updates. I really really like the face unlock which even doesn't let you see the lock screen. Amazingly fast.

Nightscape mode is also there in the latest update. Sound is good. Battery is also good but could have more like 6T. Earlier before Pie, optimisation was too high as most of the apps didn't run in background unless they are opened and kept open in Background (Outlook, Goibibo, MMT, etc) but now that is resolved. Satisfied with the phone overall.

Then comes the Oxygen OS which gives a very fluid and snappy experience of Android as it is very very close to stock Android with few minor tweaks for improvement. I am in love with this Oxygen OS.
Coming to the camera quality, it is really really great for its price point as it can easily stack up against phone which are double its price or more. Camera portrait and both normal modes are awesome. With a recent update it even got the same gesture functionality and nightmode like the OnePlus 6t.
To sum everything up, it is a great phone with great build quality and a premium look and feel with a great camera and an awesome 1080p screen.

3592,"Phone has been upgraded to Android 9.0. Very aggressive battery and RAM management. Most aggressive I have experienced so far. And yet battery barely lasts for one day and average RAM usage is around 4GB on a regular basis. I don't play any games on mobile what so ever. No specific apps for social media like Facebook Twitter etc. Everything is handled on browser, that too very sparingly. Stand by battery consumption is poorer than my previous phone i.e Moto z play. This phone was blazing fast I must say but that too for only first few days. Now face unlock has slowed down considerably.
Not happy with RAM and battery management at all. I used to run activity tracking app on my Moto whole day without any problem. But oneplus just kills them in the background. Can't track activity on Apps like Pacer, Strava etc. I don't see what's the point of having 8 gigs of RAM if the phone needs to kill apps. And even then ironically avg RAM usage is 4gigs without any games, browser, social media apps, music or video running.
There is AMOLED screen but no always on feature. No extra ordinary screen resolution. Yet battery life is pretty much ordinary. One plus could have made the device a bit cheaper with LCD screen instead of AMOLED at least. For the premium of AMOLED over LCD I am only getting better contrast ratio and that too not par with the samsungs and apples.
Audio output of speaker is heavy on trebble side and lower frequencies appear to be muted gradually. 3.5 mm jack output is average with 16 ohms earphones. And with such battery performance never thought of connecting high impedance headphones.
On rear 20MP camera is pretty much useless for photos. It's just there for claiming that the phone has dual camera setup. Google has already shown that everything can be done with only one camera. And of course notch means there is no front flash.
Can't customize the slider button used to switch between silent vibrate and ring modes. That's pretty much fixed. I would have preferred I could turn on do not disturb with that button.
If not for assured software updates and little bit of water resistance, I would have opted poco f1. Built quality doesn't matter when you are going to keep the phone, which has glass on both front and back, inside a protective case.
The heat sink appers to be on the frame so phone gets really hot while performing tasks like navigation video calls etc if you keep it inside the case provided in the pack with phone.","pacer,gla,quality,music,media,premium,side,browser,photo,usage,point,etc,management,frame,button,gig,feature,strava,notch,background,performance,case,call,heat,phone,avg,resistance,consumption,course,jack,back,facebook,slider,sink,navigation,contrast,apper,camera,update,setup,unlock,game,device,app,impedance,samsung,headphone,ratio,basi,mode,appl,battery,video,pack,ram,problem,moto,earphon,output,activity,software,screen,speaker,frequenci,life,bite,lcd,everythe,oneplu,mobile,resolution,vibrate,water,plu,play,mean,ohm,par,day,flash,front,rear,task,twitter"

3803,"I bought the OnePlus 6 as an upgrade over my last smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy S3 Neo. Having used it extensively for over 3 months now, I guess I’m qualified enough to drop an informative review.
The delivery experience was smooth, without any hiccups. Amazon informed me of the date I’d get the phone after placing my order and true to their word, it arrived on time. The packaging was secure enough to prevent anything inside from getting tainted or damaged.
The OnePlus 6 comes in a lean but elegant package. You have the 6 stamped over the box and within you’ll find the smartphone itself, a few service manuals neatly arranged, the Dash Charger and the USB-C cable. No OnePlus bullets earphones though. The phone itself comes with a scratch guard pre-applied and there’s a transparent rubbery case provided to apply on the back, just in case.
It takes a minute or two to setup and performs flawlessly. It’s been 3 months now and I’ve yet to encounter a single application or task where I’ve found the OnePlus 6 to “lag” in any sense, a common occurrence with the Galaxy S3 Neo since its very early days. There have admittedly been times when games like Asphalt Legends unexpectedly crashed but those are few and far between, like once in two weeks. For the most part, I’m able to have extended gaming sessions with absolute ease.
OnePlus is known for its stock Android inspired Oxygen OS UI and it doesn’t disappoint. I bought the 64 GB model which gave me around 53 GB of free space to start. Performance is fluid, with little fluff or bloatware installed. OnePlus also has its own iOS inspired navigation gestures which are rather intuitive; you get used to them after fiddling around a bit. Initially configured with Android 8.1 Oreo, my unit was upgraded to Android 9 Pie in September and is due for another upgrade that should bring some of the OnePlus 6T’s exciting camera features.
Speaking of which, people have spoken a lot against the camera and I’ll say this: you can get some brilliant pics if you use it the right way and circumstances, including environment setup, lighting and settings. Agreed night images are not excellent all the time but the 6T’s Nightscape mode should help change that. Video recording is crisp, even though I haven’t used it as often as I thought I would.
The AMOLED display looks sharp with strong colors. Don’t let the 1080p resolution deter you into thinking that it’s any less. In fact, not opting for Quad HD helps OnePlus last longer. I consistently average around 4-5 hours of screen time under moderate to heavy usage which increases to 7-8 hours if I’m doing nothing but watching videos. GPS consumes a lot of battery as usual.
There’s been a lot of talk about OnePlus smartphones being overpriced. For the premium build, lean OS and community experience that you’re getting, the price is honestly perfectly balanced.

I bought the OnePlus 6 during the great Indian shopping festival. I was initially waiting for the OnePlus 6T but after knowing the specs, decided to rather buy the OnePlus 6. I am completely satisfied and continue to feel that headphone jack is a great and useful thing.

3841,"Oneplus 6 performs smooth and has decent battery life. Charging speed is one of the fastest out there. Audio via head phone jack sounds really compressed and muddy i'm completely dissappointed with it's performance. Speaker sounds okay and gets reasonably loud. The camera takes some decent pictures but the images look overly processed and has aggressive noise reduction which reduces the detail and sharpness of the pictures. Video recording is good with good stabilisation and the 480 fps slow motion video mode is fun to use but it needs a bit of work as it drops quite a lot of frames and makes the video look jittery even with ample lighting. The display is really good with excellent colours and offers good saturation levels and makes the colours pop. The software is very minimalistic, snappy, fluid and easy to use. The call quality,signal reception and wifi performance are also very good. But now with phones like lg g7 thinq being available at a lower price than the oneplus 6 and oneplus 6t and oneplus ditching the headphone jack for the 6t make it hard to recommend these phones as that lg phone has ip rating, better qhd display, wireless charging and quad dac for better audio performance and a wide angle camera which is rather useful than the useless 20 mp camera of the oneplus 6 and 6t. Overall oneplus 6 is a good phone but not the best in its price range as it used to be from the oneplus 3 to the oneplus 5t. Even the oneplus 6t is also being priced close to 40000 which makes oneplus lose the customers who made the company. Even they are gradually increasing the prices and the features doesn't justify the price increase.","spee,quality,colour,picture,saturation,record,frame,work,feature,performance,call,noise,phone,reduction,charge,jack,range,rat,camera,angle,wifi,quad,headphone,mode,lot,battery,video,increase,light,detail,motion,display,image,software,speaker,sharpne,life,level,bite,oneplu,reception,stabilisation,company,price,thinq,signal,pop,qhd,customer,head,dac"

Most amazing reply was from Amazon . Amazon representative told that although they are promoting false promise but as the offer is provided by kotak bank , amazon will not take any responsibility.
Again amazon providing same offer for one plus 6t and they changed registration process this time.

4286,"After a week of using the One Plus 6, I find this phone amazing to use. I won’t go for a spec listing. You can get it from websites.
I preferred to buy this even after knowing 6T was being launched was because 6T has very little upgrades and costs 10k more.
Note to people using high end Samsung phones - You would really hate the display ,compared to Note 8/9 or s8/s9 ,this display is a joke. but overall this phone has great value for money
Originally, I have a One plus 3T. As an upgrade, I went for the Honor 10 on Flipkart. Flipkart, however, made a mess with the delivery. Please read my Flipkart review recently for details. I had to cancel the phone. The next choice after using the One plus 3T was obviously OP6.
One Plus 6 Features
The pleasant surprise for me was definitely the large 19: 9 aspect ratio FHD screen. It’s a 6.28 inches display but still easy to hold and use with one hand mostly. Being a AMOLED display, the colors are very vibrant even in sunlight. I love using it for social media ( Instagram, FB, WhatsApp) since its longer screen can fit in a number of feeds. I also enjoy reading with it. Videos in full view even with the notch are amazing to watch.
The coolest feature in the display is doing away with the physical keys or the software keys. You can use gestures to do these functions and take advantage of a larger full screen.Swiping from bottom to the middle takes you home. Swiping from left or right bottom to the middle takes you back. Swiping from the bottom to the middle and holding gives you recent apps. The problem I face is when using the keyboard very fast while typing. It just goes home sometimes which can be irritating. It’s just getting confused between the typing and the gesture to go home I think. I use the swiftkey keyboard dragging to avoid it but OP must improve this gesture.
The os is very fast thanks to it being very bloatware free and using the Snapdragon 845. There is no lag whatsoever and it is a pleasure using this phone.
Fast charging is awesome on this phone. You are all set even if you charge for half an hour to get to 60% approximately. Very handy in today’s fast-paced life.
Rear cameras @16 mp and 20 mp are quite handy to use featuring portrait and bokeh modes. The front camera also offers decent output @ 16 mp. I loved the addition of slow-motion capture on the primary camera which works well. However, you need bright lighting for it to work well.
Fingerprint and face recognition features are super fast to use. Its small thoughtful things like the option of the screen lighting up in the dark to recognize your face and unlock is what makes this device a compelling one. Speaker is mono and functional to use. Its audio via headphones is amazing, however.
Another welcome addition is true dual VOLTE support. You can have two Jio Sims running in parallel here. This means people calling your Jio number when you’re an idea or Vodafone data connection is active will be able to connect with you. Both Sims can remain on 4g.
For the cash you pay, I think this phone is amazing to own and use every day.","lag,dark,vodafone,media,portrait,jio,hold,back,swiftkey,surprise,joke,upgrade,whatsapp,bottom,video,problem,choice,hand,day,instagram,view,rear,connection,today,person,sim,feature,color,charge,addition,camera,option,unlock,device,app,ratio,hour,motion,audio,screen,recognition,feed,thing,idea,gesture,notch,week,thank,phone,bokeh,datum,display,support,output,software,speaker,fhd,middle,front,sunlight,fingerprint,detail,honor,spec,inch,type,face,money,number,advantage,capture,value,aspect,headphone,mode,websit,key,light,parallel,flipkart,life,review,pleasure,keyboard,end,function,cash,delivery,snapdragon,list"

4356,"Iam a user belonging to Computer science background, previously i have used many phones , rooted them and tried to alter and tweak settingo get the most out of them in terms of performance, screen on time etc
Its been 17 days i have been using this device as my daily driver and believe me earlier i used to root my new phones the 2nd day inorder to put custom roms to get the most out of them, but in case of OP6 the oxygen OS works flawlesly and i have not felt any need for rooting.
Pros:
-No lag in application opening, switching, opening and multitasking at all.
-fingerprint scanner is damn fast.
-Supports rapid charging till 100% battery after pie update. (30min = full charge approx)
-1080 60p and 4k 60 fps with OIS is a treat for eye to watch.
-clicks good low light photos (although u can see some grains visible if its too low lighting).
-clicks stunning normal artificial and day light photos.
-Handles all heavy games flawlesly no lag.
-gaming mode 3.0 is a definite plus.
-no over heating issue (phone will heat a bit during gaming but not too much at a level where user can get uncomfortable.)
-i play pubg at smooth graphics , extreme fps with colourful option selected doesnt lags at all even while rushing on a full squad.
-Or rushing while aircraft goes by since user face lag due to aircraft sound.
-10 min charge = 2 full pubg game kudos to that :D
-microphone and speaker quality are excellent
Cons:
- Unavailibility of original oneplus accesories in amazon and in oneplus.in aswell, been trying to get the 3D screen guard but its still out of stock
-if u play heavy games like pubg at 5% battery it will lag severly, coz OS lowers processor frequency at 5% battery level the only lag issue i faced ^_^.
-I fing the slider on the right a bit stiff it requires a little more pressure to move up or down (although experience may vary depending upon user).
-The major drawback i have found is the unavailibility of immediately lock application after leaving option in the default app lock application that comes with the oxygen OS.
-because of this i had to install third party app locks which sometimes doesnt respond to fingerprint scanner.
-fingerprint magnet since i own mirror black but i like to wipe it and keep my phone shiny so it doesnt affect me that much :D","lag,unavailibility,quality,open,science,pubg,mirror,issue,shiny,grain,driver,pressure,oxygen,eye,lock,squad,magnet,treat,term,scanner,photo,background,black,performance,case,heat,phone,charge,experience,application,slider,computer,min,lower,amazon,sound,update,face,option,game,con,device,stock,app,graphic,pro,frequency,mode,party,battery,user,light,inorder,artificial,time,pie,speaker,screen,aircraft,level,guard,bite,oneplu,settingo,right,nee,plu,day,drawback,rom,fingerprint,switch,custom"

If you zoom any picture, the picture clarity is worst than 10k mobiles. Very disappointment from OnePlus. Only u hv to watch the pics without zoom.

Overall camera clarity is like less than 10k mobile.
Pros : Mobile build quality, display, Network Signal, Finger Print, face unlock, Fastness are excellent. Charging is ultra fast and the best among the flagship mobiles which i used.  No heating issue. Ultimate front and back appearance.
Camera quality is superb but expected the best from oneplus.
Cons : They would have provided ear phones and some interesting unique features and nothing unique to explore in this phone. Bit heavy but manageable.

9. Face unlock is very good

4522,"I'll tell you why OP6 is better than OP6 T overall and where OP6 T score more points. Below are features of OP6T compared to OP6.
1. OP6T has bigger battery. Around3.7k mah. The only good thing about T.
2. Little bigger screen. Same hardware though, with update on GGlass 6. OP6 has GG5
3. On screen finger print. Prob is it is a bit slow. Takes more than 4s on avg. OP claims 3.4s. And you need to light up screen before using fingerprint to power up the sensor on screen. So technically you have to click power button and long-touch the screen.
4. Point number 3 leads no space for headphone jack (idk why OP can't give a headphone jack on top)
5. 1, 3 lead to increase in phone thickness. It is not as slim as OP6
6. Camera is completely same as in OP6, both hardware and software with additional night mode. I anyway use Pixel 2, 3 camera app software downloaded from xdm.
7. Base variant is same cost as base variant of OP6, but will have 128GB storage instead of 64GB. Good thing if OP6 sells without discount. But not happening.
8. Notch size decreased. Known thing. Drop 💧 notch. Not at all a pro.

4588,"My review is based on my thoughts and my experience which I never found on the internet while searching about this smartphone.
I would speak about an experience of people like me for whom this smartphone is the first flagship killer they ever bought.
1. This phone is damn fast and we all know that. So we never get to experience anything like a lag. A whole new experience for anyone for the ones who are planning to change their phone from budget to a mid-range flagship.
2. One shouldn't define it as flagship. It's not a flagship. It's a flagship killer which means you will have a flagship like experience on a smartphone which looks or feels like a budget smartphone when held in hand. It doesn't feel like using a true flagship device. note: If you have 10k extra go for the LG G7+ ThinQ. It is a complete package and a true flagship...!! Also, Pixel 2 XL is available at 40k during festival offers so you can have a look at it too.
3. My major questions when I was confused in between buying Oneplus 6 or LG G7+ ThinQ was
(i) which camera was better! Oneplus 6 or Lg G7+ ThinQ...?? The answer is LG G7 is better except for Oneplus has an edge over better video taking technology and better selfies.
(ii) Which screen feels better for the eye...?? The screen quality on LG G7+ ThinQ feels a lot better than Oneplus 6 despite G7 being an IPS display and Oneplus 6 an Optic AMOLED.
4. The audio quality is the biggest silent drawback of Oneplus 6. In other words, I never enjoyed while playing a song through my headphones.
Overall, I would definitely suggest buying a Oneplus smartphone to anyone for its amazing software, its speed, and performance for the given price.","spee,lag,package,killer,technology,quality,festival,flagship,budget,person,optic,eye,internet,anyone,performance,answer,phone,experience,look,one,thought,range,camera,device,headphone,smartphone,lot,edge,video,question,display,word,software,review,screen,oneplu,selfie,pixel,song,hand,thinq,price,drawback,anyth"

I won't describe the specs as everyone is thorough with it. I consider it the year's most optimised mobile. And dash charging has to be mentioned... it is inspiring. The phone doesn't heat up. I have played games, watched videos and browsed the web almost continuously. Yet I haven't felt any significant heating issues. The primary camera is wonderfully tuned. And the display is beautiful. The only drawback I have found is that it lacks stereo and dual audio speakers. Just a single, bottom facing speaker. For the amount we pay, that feature should have been provided. But otherwise, this is the best phone yet. However, if the One Plus 6T turns out to be better and sells for the same rate, it would be a blow to the present ""6"" owners.","year,issue,spec,magnet,feature,heat,owner,phone,amount,charge,opinion,everyone,camera,game,variant,video,web,display,speaker,mobile,rate,fingerprint,hand,drawback,pearl,sheen,blow"

I bought this product on 29th of August and I have been using this for the last 2 months. I am facing too many problems with this system as its getting hang sometimes when incoming calls, and I am unable to answer to the calls. Also, It's getting stagnant while I connect my headphones.
When it comes to its camera, I have some major problems while recording the video in a good room light conditions (the pixels of the video is getting confined). Slow motion video out is getting flickering in close shots and several others problems. I am sort of tired using this over-hyped mobile device and I really want to return this phone to Amazon and apply for the refund as I believe Amazon and Rocket Kommerce show their credibility to respond to this and act wisely.

Just one point of caution. Since it's a glass phone, you may want to get a case with chunky borders. But as it's already a slightly larger phone, you might want to be cautious in case you have hands that are on the smaller side.
On the battery, entirely on usage. It should last you about 5 hrs 30 on screen time and if you got a schedule that keeps you off your phone, a day is easily done.
On the whole, am really happy with the purchase.

5019,"Let me clarify, the product meets all its criteria and rather excellently. But, this certainly not a flagship killer.
The good:
1. Phone feel sturdy, light and handy. Comes with Oneplus branded back case and already fixed screen protector
2. 128GB is literally unlimited, wont miss absence of memory card
3. Very smooth and user friendly software, you will feel at home irrespective of whichever other skin you were used to
4. Camera is good, but low light quality leaves a lot to desire
5. Battery backup is comparable to other flagships, easily last through the day. Dash charger is also pretty first, again comparable to other flagship
6. Screen quality is decent, but a notch lower to Samsung sAMOLED. Sound from the single speaker is adequate. Sound is loud, but you surely mark the missing depth from a LG or HTC.
7. Regular updates are a treat
Not so good:
1. A flagship killer that saves money by skipping headphones. Samsung comes with AKG co-branded one while LG gets Tone.
2. Packaging is too ordinary, while Samsung S series or LG G series makes you feel special. Comes with a pin ejector and charger, nothing else. Skims on manuals and user guides too.
3. Water proofing is their word vs the world. Do dare test it without an IPS certification.
4. Though good quality case and screen protector provided, but somehow feels short of the likes of Amzer etc. I would have preferred an standard headphone instead of case.
5. Data transfer software does not consider memory cards of old phone. Lack of memory card support and an usb adapter (Samsung gives them) means, its an herculean task to transfer your data.
To summarize, Oneplus6 wont disappoint you, but at the same time wont excite you either. At the similar  price point, Samsung S8 or LG G7 comes with much bling factors to keep you engaged for sometime. Regarding 8 GB RAM, unless you run bench-marking software everyday, you wont notice a difference.","package,killer,transfer,quality,manual,flagship,adapter,akg,backup,point,difference,treat,skim,absence,notch,ejector,charger,case,phone,world,memory,back,serie,lack,camera,sound,update,money,proof,product,depth,like,headphone,amzer,lot,factor,battery,guide,user,certification,datum,ram,bench,skin,time,tone,word,software,speaker,screen,dash,support,water,oneplu,protector,price,home,day,usb,nothe,criterion,task,sometime,card"

Completely impressed with the dash charging back then in 2015, the only disadvantage i have ever felt in OP3 is battery life as it drains fast. That too is completely sorted in OP6 as i am getting more than a day in average usage and close to a full day with live streaming on mobile data and continous screen on time. Camera is a vast improvement which will definitely compete with the best. Guys just think about the price point here and you can easily forget any minor flaws. The only one which i think fares better than OP6 is Note 9. But again it cost 70k. Finally i got the red color which i longed for. Completely satisfied with the purchase.

5081,"I'm a pro smartphone user. I judge every aspect for the review.
Pros-
1. Dash charge is amazing. 1hr 10 mints hardly and full charge. Battery 1 day on normal usage.
2. Beautiful display. AmoLed really is superb.
3. Daylight or artificial light, you won't complain the camera.
4. Beautiful design, no doubt premium.
5. OxygenOS is like liquid.
6. Snapdragon 845 really boosts your internet speed.
7. Never lags in any game.
8. Ah those gestures. I love that.
9. Who complained about speaker, I don't feel it is low. It is good infact.
10. That notch! Pause.
Cons-
1. Very fragile. You have to keep it very carefully. Has tendency to slip.
2. Don't rely on Gorilla glass 5, it breaks. I've seen it. Probably the back glass will break first.
3. OxygenOS is great. I don't understand why it hangs sometimes. I need to lock screen and then turn it on to be workable. Maybe unstable Andriod Pie. Most hanged app - FB messenger
4. A bit large screen. You can't use it by one hand, provided you got medium sized hands.
5. Camera has issues in low light. Still better than Poco or Zenfone.
6. Selfie has some problem in artifical lights. The background is taken in low pixels. So, if someone is standing behind, he will not be as clear as other at front.
7. Woaah, the fingerprints it catches. Massive bro!
8. Water resistant huh? Really? Should give an IP rating.
9. Fingerprint is fast, no doubt. But sometimes, I have to tap twice or thrice over sensor to unlock.
10. I donno what security they uses for face unlock. It is lightning fast and even unlocks when not looking at it. Face unlock is weak security wise.
Give it a like if it serves your purpose.","spee,purpose,gla,premium,messenger,gesture,issue,liquid,doubt,notch,internet,background,security,daylight,charge,back,mint,rat,camera,zenfone,tendency,face,unlock,game,app,woaah,aspect,smartphone,someone,battery,pause,user,light,problem,display,bro,pie,speaker,design,review,dash,usage,bite,screen,water,gorilla,pixel,infact,hand,snapdragon,day,sensor,front,oxygeno,fingerprint,andriod"

5086,"Amazing phone, I've been using mid range Moto and Sony phones till now and thought of upgrading to a flagship level phone. This phone does live up to the hype and carries on the heritage and standards set by previous one plus phones like 5t and 5. I'll try to highlight a few pros and cons
Pros:
1.Excellent display
2.Flagship Snapdragon 845 Cpu- ensures excellent performance
3.6GB RAM- I bought the 6 gig version, I feel 6gigs are sufficient for graphic intensive gaming and multitasking. If you want more storage space, consider the 8gig RAM variant.
4.Oxygen OS: OnePlus has done a fabulous job with the oxygen OS, it is a refined version of Android, you get only the essential stuff on your phone minus the bloatware. Fluid UI, no lags, great optimisation. With Android pie, Battery life has improved.
5.Camera: Most of the buyers consider this to be a critical aspect while purchasing a phone. I'm not a Camera enthusiast but the dual cameras on this beast offer decent photography options.
6:Build quality: The phone has a glass back and the overall build quality matches phones that sell in the 40-50k range. Truly a Flagship killer.
7.Water resistance: The phone does offer a degree of water resistance, one plus says the phone can not be used underwater and there is no IP certification. So the phone is good enough only to withstand splashes and rain outings.
Cons:
1.Sound: Sound output through the loudspeaker could have been better.

5267,"Check the photos I snapped using Oneplus 6 and you can judge it by yourself. Nowadays having depth in photos is very much trending, but the awesome thing which I personally like is the detailing of light the camera captured, never expected such awesome results. it can certainly compete with DSLRs in terms of composition. Apart from this very fast in focusing and capturing the image, that sunrise image I captured on moving vehicle, it's simply awesome.
Few other things which I find it unique and you won't find it any reviews are;
1. Text messages are automatically sorted in the inbox and it's easy to maintain important messages and notification SMS properly organized.
2. I have multiple Gmail accounts for official use and each account have multiple contacts stored in it, so after adding all those Gmail accounts in the phone it is only syncing contacts from my primary Gmail account and therefore my phone book contacts are not getting messed up.
3. Gesture control is awesome, it gives freedom to use the phone as per our ease and one can also customize it on different levels.
4. Network and internet speed is too good.
and I am sure there is much more in this phone as I will go exploring.
Apart from this, phone looks are pretty awesome and rich. It gives a premium feel and the phone is very much noticeable.
I am not a gamer so for me, battery is lasting almost 24 hours with frequent usage of fb, whatsapp, gmail, insta, google, skype and of course phone calls.
The only thing missing is an earphone, I think the company should provide that too, otherwise, phone comes with case cover and pre-installed screen protector.
Overall, you won't regret buying this phone. if you are landing in the range of 20-25k, then push a little bit and go for this phone it will be a paisa vasool for you.
I hope this review will be helpful.  Good Luck.","spee,inbox,network,account,gesture,vehicle,premium,term,photo,internet,skype,case,call,phone,book,course,look,earphone,ease,range,the,use,camera,notification,paisa,luck,depth,whatsapp,gmail,dslr,feel,text,message,hour,battery,result,cover,light,contact,image,review,screen,level,usage,bite,oneplu,gamer,composition,protector,freedom,company,thing,vasool,detail,control"

I was using iPhone 6 for past few years. Now I wanted a dual sim mobile and after going through many reviews and ratings this one seemed to be the best in my budget. Now I've been using this mobile for more than a week.
The battery stays for whole days use for a normal web users like me. Even if you use continuously for long hours, no worry you've dash charging which works too good. The camera quality is also good.  As the caption says the speed is also really fast. And speaker, thought the sound is not great, it is not bad either.
For those who are confused between 64 GB and 128 GB variant I would recommend normal users like those who use FB, instagram and very rare games, taking pictures once in a while go 64 GB, it is fine. If you're a heavy user, you download a lot, store lot of movies, store pictures for a long time can't transfer them to laptop or hard disk regularly (atleast 15 days once) only then opt for 128GB.
Drawback I felt is it is slightly over priced with no headphones and wide angle camera but as a overall product it is a value for money deal except that.","spee,quality,picture,year,budget,sim,movie,week,charge,one,deal,range,camera,angle,sound,iphone,caption,money,game,product,value,headphone,while,lot,hour,battery,variant,user,web,worry,store,time,speaker,review,dash,mobile,day,drawback,instagram,rating,disk"

1- Delivery takes a entire week.
2- Phone box was little bit crushed on edges. Nitpicking though I feel it's bcoz of poor handling of the retailer.
3- Phone is fast. Got Android pie update. Felt some games are not optimized played Pokemon go and it doesn't play it in full screen . Even pubg had some minor stuters at first but now it runs smoothly.
4-Dash charge is best feature. It really does charge it real quick.
5- You need to get a scratch guard and a case immediately. Found minor scratches on 2 days use on the pre applied scratch guard. Case provided is good but I do prefer original op6 bumper case.

2) Excellent Battery life: Power management is extremely good. I have used Xiaomi phone with 4000mAh battery but despite of having 3300mAh battery one plus 6 lasts a little long for day.
3)Dash charging is like cherry on the cake.
4) Sound quality is even better than Samsung Galaxy S9 and many in the market

But everything is not perfect in this after using for more than a 1 month I can say it.
Pro's:-
Screen Quality:- 10/10 (Very Crisp and Sharp, Optic Amoled helps a Lot)
Sound- speaker is Very Loud and Clear.Dual speaker should have been given in this price but no matter, its not a deal breaker.(9/10)
Camera - One of the Most Unique and Awesome thing of OP 6 i can say now. picture are very brighter and Range is Very Good even you zoom it.Specially in Day light,The photos are just Fantastic.Front Camera is Very Good for Selfies.Bokeh mode for both rear and front is Awesome,edge detection is superb.Video is also very Stable.(20/10)
Calling- Using both Vodafone 4G and Jio 4G continuously.have no issues with it.Finely working,speaker is also loud and clear for hearing.(10/10)
Alert Slider- Very Useful Implementation (10/10)
Updates- After Buying a New phone,Updates matter the most.and Yes,I can definitely say, Oneplus keeping their promises by giving major and Minor Updates.Just Receives Android 9.0, 3 weeks ago.This is only the 7th phone to get this Update in India.
Box Contains and Accessories:- All things Are rightly given in box,the preapplied screen guard,The Back cover is just Outstanding,and the Awesome Dash charger.
I already Got SandStone cover in free with Phone when I bought it.after One month I bought Original Oneplus Avenger's Edition back cover Which is Love to me.
Con's -
Battery Life - Mostly A weak point for this device.For casual use it will last for full day but you have to charge it in night I'm sure.and if u r a heavy user, you will be very Disappointed with it.As it is running with world's Top most Processor and GPU,battery sucks up quite easily.and Also After Pie(Android 9.0),Battery life is Not stable at all.
But,afterall You have Dash charger in your hand,which is just extraordinary.
(Over all 7/10)
Auto brightness- Not very well calibrated Even in Pie,but still managble,I'm not saying that it's worst,but it should be better.i think OP will fix it in future Updates.
Headphone jack- Though the phone have it,but still it is not Outstanding.The beats are flat.i have Heavy Sony's Headphone,still Don't get the true beats frm it.
Overall Rating i will give (9.5/10)..If you have budget,Just go with it.None can beat this,in this range.You are getting a Lot,and also Oneplus Community is there in side.The Camera is Just Hats off!","android,edition,hat,vodafone,picture,box,issue,budget,point,optic,photo,avenger,week,charger,phone,world,gpu,back,deal,night,month,range,use,camera,the,update,auto,implementation,india,headphone,beast,lot,mode,edge,detection,battery,afterall,user,cover,light,community,pie,speaker,screen,guard,dash,life,sony,oneplu,love,promise,everythe,price,processor,hand,day,beat,overall,front,thing,rear,matter"

5995,"Well, you know that feeling of awesomeness, when you get more than what you expect, this is what it is for me with this fantastic device.
Brief background: I've been the most loyal Iphone customer- bought each and every iphone device till 6S when it got launched and in the process spent a lot of money imagining I am 'investing' in the best. I loved iphone for their robustness and simplicity (yawn), and style (really).
This time around, I compared various devices: Iphone X, S9, Huawei phones and OnePlus 6 and wanted to break through my loyalty by buying a non apple product. It wasn't a simple choice to switch your loyalty, so has to be really an upswing to convince me.
I tested most of the products and ended up buying OnePlus 6. Below is the summary of Considerations, expectations and outcome after 2 weeks of using the device. I will compare it to my iphone 6S as that was my going out model.
1. Speed: I need good speed- as I do multiple things, apps, bookings, payments, excel sheets, ppt presentations, all thru the phone. I m not a gamer but probably use up more bandwidth and compute than what gamers do.
My iphone tired me no end and I believe the lack of compatability will make my iphone x experience similar if not worse.
Oneplus simply blew me away- blazing speed, accuracy, I don't make spelling mistakes when I write ( somehow I feel the keyboard is arranged suberbly well- Iphone was a disaster for me). The phone solved multiple small things for me- taking long screenshots, faster operations. I somehow feel, that my internet speed (dumber), is faster on Oneplus than Iphone.
2. Build: I wanted a phone just like iphone that's robust and strong. One Plus 6 is much better, sturdier and the touch-feel is superb.
3. Charging/Battery: Biggest concern with Iphone was the battery life and it still is for most apple devices. Oneplus is blazing fast charging with dashcharger, holds charge for atleast 1 day for me with extreme usage of the device. ( I use my phone for professional usage) v/s an Iphone 6s which would not even last me with 2.5 hrs of charge.
The charging cable is very robust, the charge connector all- are pretty high grade.
4. Photos/Pictures/Scan: My iphone 6S wasn't bad and I've seen Iphone X which is good but I wanted REAL like feel- finished and touched up a bit to give a ready to serve picture. Oneplus 6 exceeds my requirements here. Pics of my newborn daughter come out very neat and deep. The depth feature (probably using the 2nd camera) is amazing and the pictures does show her hair over the face, dimples and smirks.. basically if you are able to see the emotions thru the portrait - that defines the pic more than the mega pixels.
5. Size: Obviously the size is much better than iphone 6S whilst any other device could match it. Though the screen clarity and videos through my prime video are flawless - better than tv lcd.
4. Price: an obvious one- is super attractive for the device. With loads of features and high build grade, It definitely will make apple run for the money.
The only aspect that I miss are original oneplus earphones that should come with the device to make it a well packaged device to use.
Overall I think, I made a superb choice with this device. To me, if an Iphone X and OP 6 come within the same price range for similar specs, I would definitely still choose OP for it's speed, built and quality.
Wishing OP all the best.

6091,"Bought this phone about a 6month ago and this is my opinion after using it for a 6month.
Really it's smart phone .
About hardware:
The outer case is premium in feel and touch. The display ratio to body is perfect. You won't notice any borders as such on all corners. Display is pretty vivid and touch is suoer responsive. The device feels sturdy enough to handle small and medium impacts. The side buttons are easy to operate and does not feel too soft or too notchy either.
Camera:
Camera is not super but definitely a good one. There are lot of ootions in Pro mode just like we get un DSLR. You can set everything custom as per your requirement like focus, aperture, ISO, shutter soeed etc which eill results in very customisable photos.
Sound and Microphone:
Siund at loudspeakers are perfect and audible even in crowded places. Earpiece for calling fullfills the expectatios. Since Oneplus dies not provide the headphones in box, you can use any 3.5 mm headphones. I am using Apple earpods with thus device with no issues for music and calling and the music experience is not different than any iOS device.
Battery backup:
I simoly love the dadh charging technology of this device. It charges uoto 40 prr cent of battery just in 10 minutes. Overall battery backuo is upto the mark. A single charge will be sufficient with heavy internet usage for a day.
Overall performance:
Yes. This device does heats up a bit when you play any high end games for approx 30 minutes which is very natural as you are using all it's components at extereme levels for better gaming experience. But again, even the battery performance is suoerb for gaming too.
Few areas for improvement:
There are some areas in terms of user UI experience which Oneplus needs to improve a bit. Like other Android devices, this also keeps a lot of garbage files on you ROM which you need to clear time to time. Of course, it won't cause any slowness but it will definitely occupy a space on your ROM.
FINAL verdict:
I woukd definitely recommend this device because even other high end Android devices does not cone uo with such configuration at this orice tag. Snapdragon 845 with 640 GPU packed with 6/8 GB RAM is an astonishing combination in this price bucket.

Pros:
1) The amoled screen on this device is best in the class offers great viewing angles with deep black.
2) Battery on this device is just awesome i am getting over 6+hrs sot every time with gaming around an hour.
3) Speaker output is good considering single bottom firing speaker.
4) Camera on this device is good,takes some good day and night time photos.
5) Dash charge is awesome charges the phone completely in 70min.
6) Got this in awesome deal from amazon.
Now cons:
1) Output via 3.5mm headphone jack is bad ,i tried different earphones ranging from 2k to 12k but believe me audio is worst part of this device.
2) Glass back is a finger print magnet so use it with the supplied case in the box.
3) Bokeh effect/depth effect is a hit or miss from both cameras.

6484,"First of all kudos to Amazon for providing great deal and timely delivery. I got this one for 27k and received package within 24 hours of placing order.
Now about phone, first impression is about the great screen. I've always been a fan of an Amoled display just because they offer deep blacks. Oneplus 6 is having really nice display with a notch (I don't have a problem with notch display). Great viewing angles and Color reproduction.
About performance, its Qualcomm's current year's flagship SDM845 so obviously no lag at all.
The camera, it's great even in low light photography thanks to the wide f/1.7 aperture. Edge detection is accurate in portrait pictures.
The battery, it's nice as well if not great. I am getting a full day of battery life on 90% charge with around 5.5 hours of screen on time. And the dash charging, it is the most amazing thing about this device. It charges the phone about 65-70 % in 30-35 minutes which is great!
The only con is that speaker output is not good at all. And the glass back is fingerprint magnet and seems fragile so we can't use the phone without a case.","lag,package,gla,picture,order,year,flagship,portrait,magnet,notch,black,performance,color,case,thank,phone,charge,one,back,minut,deal,the,angle,camera,con,device,impression,photography,edge,reproduction,detection,battery,hour,problem,display,time,output,speaker,screen,life,dash,oneplu,aperture,kudo,delivery,fan,day,qualcomm,fingerprint"

6553,"I think OnePlus 6 is by far the best device to ever come out from the OnePlus family. Yes OnePlus 6T will take over but this was a great deal. I have upgraded to the latest Android P and it works wonder on this device. Evrrybody knows the configuration of the device so there is no much to talk about it but what matters is the brand providing you all this at a price range of just 35k. During the sale, the price dropped to 29,999/- but still other devices with the same configuration charge more than 50k so if you are a geek who understands electronics, you will never buy something just for the sake of the brand. Coming to the OnePlus 6 camera, I think it can click some of the most amazing pictures, breathtaking slow motion videos and other smooth videos with the help of inbuilt stabilizer. Dash charger is damn quick. Just more than an hour to charge from 0 - 100%. Being a food blogger and budding filmmaker, camera is my most important feature on this device but also being a complete enthusiast for games, it's Snapdragon 845 delivers to the promise with no lags even on heavy games like PubG and others.

DESIGN
It's the best looking smartphone in this range the premium finishing and glass back makes it really eye catching but the metal part looks fragile at the same time the color looks to be easily scratchable.
DISPLAY
It has one of the best 1080p AMOLED panel colors are crisp and vibrant but i miss the sharpness of ips displays
BATTERY
I am easily getting 6 hours of SOT but i am not a hardcore user  standby time and everything is at top and not to forget dash charger this thing is special
CAMERA
Pictures qualities are good they have depths in it as far my usage it gets the job done
SOFTWARE
I was really excited about that part of this phone because of its closeness to stock Android and  it's smooth buttery smooth but have some bugs in pie i can see lags and stutter time to time. Gestures are not optimised completely and it's just doesn't feel original like i was using in nokia 8 which is android one device.
PERFORMANCE
6gb ram and sd845 nothing to say anything here.
My final thoughts
I got this Device for 27000rs and it's the best you can get for this price as far as i can tell a premium design amoled display and top notch performance but i wouldn't have bought it for 35000rs it doesn't justify 35000 imo display could be better build quality could have been better i know software bugs would be iron out with time.

7145,"Just switched from the Poco F1 to the OnePlus 6. Both phones are excellent, but the OnePlus 6 is slightly better imo. This review intends to solely compare the OP6 to the Poco F1.
Poco F1 -
Pros-
1. Price - Unbeatable price!
2. Battery - The 4000 MAH battery of the Poco is an absolute delight. It lasted me 1 1/2 days of moderate to heavy usage, as compared to 1 day with the OnePlus 6.
3. IR face unlock - the face unlock on the Poco is better than the OP6 imo. It works in pitch dark settings and is faster. (Note: OP6 face unlock is also very very good, don't get me wrong!)
4. Speakers - The stereo-like speakers on the Poco trump the OP6's below average speakers.
5. Liquid cooling - I haven't tested the OP6 with heavy gaming so can't comment for the OP6, shall update after doing so. However, heavy gaming on the Poco is a joy, no heating whatsoever.
OnePlus 6- apart from the above features, the OnePlus 6 beats the Poco F1 hands down.
Pros-
1. Screen - AMOLED, much natural Colors and darker blacks.
2. Oxygen OS - much better than MiUI, cleaner with faster updates. Already have 9.0 Pie on my OnePlus 6, still waiting for the Poco update. Also, the gestures and other features on Oxygen OS are incredible.
3. Camera - again, haven't tested the OP6 camera heavily, so shall update when I do so. This one's a really close call. I really liked the Poco camera, but from my initial impressions, the OP6 just beats it.
4. Dash Charge - absolutely insane speed! Much better than the Poco quick charger.
5. Water resistance - although there is no official IP rating for the OnePlus, YouTube videos and reviews prove otherwise. The OP6 is as good as water resistant. The Poco, on the other hand, is not even splash proof.
6. Looks - the OnePlus is a much better phone in terms of looks and feel. I also love the alert slider on the OnePlus 6.
7. Price - Got the OnePlus 6 for a great price in the great Indian sale! For the sale price, I would blindly go with the OnePlus 6 over the Poco F1.
Performance - tie. Same processors, same results! Both are blazing fast. They breeze through anything you throw at them.
Conclusion - both are great phones, but if you manage to get your hands on a OP6 during the Amazon sale, I would go ahead and buy the OnePlus over the Poco without thinking twice!","spee,conclusion,stereo,gesture,oxygen,term,feature,poco,charger,color,heat,call,phone,performance,black,resistance,delight,charge,one,look,slider,cool,rat,camera,amazon,update,face,unlock,youtube,game,proof,impression,joy,mah,battery,setting,video,result,pitch,pie,speaker,review,usage,screen,dash,water,oneplu,tie,hand,processor,price,sale,day,anyth"

One day delivery turned into a 3 day delivery and the courier guys asked me to come to my office on a Saturday to pick up the product.
2. Packaging -
The product box seemed as it has been bitten by dogs or tossed around multiple times before being handed over to me.
3. Dusty & Soiled outside
The entire outside bag was soiled & full of dust. Remember its an item with 35k value
4. Phone - Pictures
This phone comes to at par with the likes of POCO & HONOR made devices. I have done technical evaluation of the pictures and their data. Don't know why should someone pay 15 k more for the similar aspects.
5. Oxygen OS
This is to plain and simple and doesn't allow much customisation.
6. Speaker
External down firing speakers are average and doesn't seems that they are a part of 35k phone.
7. Battery drains very fast so you have to utilise your jumbo charger very often in a day, such a pain.
Moreover AMAZON says you can't post negative reviews about delivery and experience as per them that are least bothered about it.

7468,"Bought this Flagship smartphone from OnePlus 3 months back and here are my observations after using it for 3 months.
1. Camera is just fabulous. It works like a DSLR with the inbuilt features that are available in DSLR. It supports features like focus, aperture, ISO etc can set all those features custom as per our requirement.
2. Sound and Microphone quality is just awesome and it is audible even in crowded places. Earpiece is good to take calls with nice and clear volume ratio. Earphones are not their in box quite disappointing after paying much but you can use any 3.5 mm jack earphones of good sound quality. There is no issues found for music as well you can experince calling and music as an IOS device (Apple) supports.
3. In love with its battery backup and dash charging technology. It charges almost 60% of phone battery in just 15 mins. Battery backup is awesum as a full charge of it lasts for a full day along with heavy internet usage. Comes with 3300 mAH lithium Polymer battery.
4. Best gaming experience ever compared to all other smartphones I used to play games earlier in phones from such good brands like Nokia, Samsung, MI, and even Apple iPhone 7. You can enjoy playing high end games like PUBG one of the trending games nowadays.
5. No heating problem faced while using it for long hours with heavy apps, games and internet surfing. Its a reliable phone.
6. There are lot of trash files stored on phone's RAM which needs to be cleared time to time so that it will not cause any slowness while operating the phone.
7. It looks very classy when holding in hand as well as its outer case is very comfortable in feel & touch. Display ratio perfectly fits its design as there are no borders. Touch is vivid and highly capacitive 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 5 used on both the front and back so no chances of screen tempering even when there is no screenguard/tempered glass applied on display. Watching movies is very enjoyable everytime.
8. Top Notch Speed Flagship Killer comes with 8GB RAM with 256GB of Storage is enough for all heavy files and games. It supports dual nano SIM with dual standby 4G+4G which is quite good and lovable.
9. When it comes to operating system and processor it comes with Android Oreo 8.1 Oxygen with Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 Octa Core Processor which is highest available in market at this price.
10. Its face unlock features works very well when compared to iPhone X. Fingerprint sensor works fine, Water Resistant feature haven't checked as it is costly so I always avoid water from the device after even its water resistant.
11. User Interface can be improved a lil bit more for steady use to everyone and earphones can be their inside the box at this price range and a brand should manage to provide maximum accessories along with its Flagship phone atleast.
12. Overall performance is good as device works very well on all stages of usage where as while using it continuosly along with its all components at extreme levels. And its stability over the android is mindblowing.
13. Finally, I would recommend everyone to buy this device who is looking for a phone at this price range. No such phone is available in market with such high end configurations at this price range.","issue,storage,observation,movie,slowne,back,jack,month,use,market,chance,problem,place,bite,oneplu,love,hand,processor,day,android,technology,lil,box,file,microphone,sim,volume,polymer,internet,touch,feature,case,octa,apple,charge,everyone,range,camera,sound,unlock,device,app,stage,ratio,interface,mah,hour,nano,user,ram,system,time,design,screen,gorilla,price,surf,custom,iso,lithium,killer,gla,music,focu,flagship,oreo,screenguard,backup,oxygen,stability,notch,awesum,performance,heat,phone,earpiece,nokia,min,smartphone,lot,border,display,earphon,accessory,aperture,configuration,front,inbuilt,qualcomm,fingerprint,trash,spee,quality,pubg,everytime,call,experience,atleast,iphone,face,game,requirement,feel,dslr,battery,component,usage,level,water,end,core,snapdragon,sensor,brand"

2) battery not lasting for whole day in normal usage
3) Google search not working. Nothing happens on click of Google search widget
4) some apps not responding at all on click of icon. Quite strange is, sometimes Amazon app doesn't open at all which is exclusive place to buy this phone
5) you can't turn off WiFi .it automatically turns back on

The camera is just awesome ... The pictures in both day and night are very very crisp and clear. .. the selfie is also very good ...
The Mirror black has a very shiny back cover with a mirror finish and feels very good in the hand ...

I ordered the mobile on Oct 9th at 12:30 and got delivered the next day around 10:30; this despite me residing in a remote location.  So thumbs up Amazon you have a wide reach and you score high over your immediate competitor on this aspect.  Now a brief review of the product.  I'm not a technical man, just putting it in simple layman's language here.  The device per se looks uber cool with gorgeous glossy finish.  Face unlock feature is pretty quick, it unlocks in milliseconds great work.  I've read some negative reviews regarding fingerprint unlocking feature.  I think if there's any dirt in your finger it doesn't recognize quickly else it works good.  The dash charger is one of its kind, it takes 75 mins to charge from 0 to 100%, and should easily last 24 hours.  Software security update is released recently dated September 5, 2018, better update that once you start using the device.  I did use the quick gesture feature for answering calls, but it's not up to the mark, it lags at times.  In sum, the device performance is great, any task is a smooth sailing.  Camera looks good and satisfactory.","gesture,kind,finger,work,feature,charger,sail,security,performance,location,answer,call,millisecond,language,experience,reach,layman,thumb,september,camera,amazon,min,update,face,finish,unlock,man,device,product,aspect,competitor,mark,uber,hour,time,dirt,software,review,dash,mobile,fingerprint,delivery,day,task,sum,oct"

2. Use of secondary camera is really limited.. I think it could be extended by oneplus.
3. No wireless charging, no IP rating & no stereo speakers.
4. In MI 10k budget devices we have a unique feature which i really like, that is IR blaster, i think these small features could have been implemented in it which really makes a device stand out.
5. There is no 4k display present.
DO NOTE ONEPLUS : Most of the samsung users do not switch from samsung to Oneplus because of the samsung's 4k display.
I seriously feel if u think about these changes no one could have thought of buying any other smartphone in the market.
Apart from OXYGEN_OS or the SPEED u give us in your devices, are the only things people are going for. But sadly these are also given by xiaomi in poco series and in less price (although it gives miui but in terms of speed, processor, etc it is all same). So your mobiles does not stand out anywhere uniquely as of now.

P.S:- I'm giving this review after using it for 3 n 1/2 months.
1. Build quality awesome. Specially glass finishing gives a elegant look.
2. Display AMOLED. The best you get. N notch 😍
3. Camera is awesome. After Android Pie update the HDR mode is not there. Overally one of the best compared to S9+, iPhone 7+ etc.
4. What can I say about Processor, the name is enough SNAPDRAGON 845 😎.
5. Dual 4G stand by. Better for people like me who use Jio n Airtel. It's very helpful in some areas where Jio is not so fast switching to Airtel 4G will help.
6. Battery life is good but If you are Mi user then you will be bit disappointed 😁. You can use the phone for nearly 24 hrs. By switching on data, playing games, social sites browsing..","killer,quality,gla,flagship,person,airtel,notch,stand,phone,one,look,everyone,name,month,camera,iphone,finish,game,mode,battery,area,user,datum,display,sit,pie,review,life,hdr,nee,anyth,processor,snapdragon,switch"

Interestingly, the Blancco diagnostics app wouldn't even launch, it kept crashing repeatedly. The fingerprint sensor doesn't always register and wake the device. Besides that, there's the classic Oxygen OS issue of large battery drain that shows up as Google Play Services or Android OS. Now that I'm forced to use the faulty device without replacement, I think I'll have to try some custom ROMs and hope that they resolve some of the issues, the battery drain at least.","visit,year,issue,oxygen,replacement,one,amazon,service,devic,device,app,blancco,battery,support,oneplu,drain,play,tech,diagnostic,fan,home,day,sensor,rom,fingerprint,rep,custom"

But if u have used or using a Samsung flagship devices as I used S7 edge and next s8 plus then this OnePlus 6 can't never satisfy you in term of user experience which is of very premium level when u use Samsung flagship devices. After selling my s8 plus I bought this OnePlus 6 on 9 Aug and within 3 months this phone is unable to keep me interested using anymore. Afterall it is oppo vivo brother. The software experience and UI are of same cheep Chinese quality. Marketing of this phone was done in such a was that it has almost same camera quality as s8 plus. But trust me it is no where near the Samsung S7 edge and s8 plus camera. Though it says it has Amoled display but the quality of display is like other Full hd + mobiles. After using super Amoled quad HD curved display of Samsung flagship which gives a treat to ur eyes with its immersive feel the OnePlus 6 display will give u disappointment only. By investing 35 thousands u may say to ur self that u got a flagship processor ram latest Android in half of the price of Samsung flagship device which I also made myself understood while purchasing this device. But when it comes to real life usage. It give u an experience and feeling of a cheep Chinese Mobile of rs 15 to 20 thousand. I made a mistake.

I am unable to activate hotspot and can't able to download any app. The basic functionalities are not working. I regret deeply why I bought this phone. There are only 7-8 service centers across India. I went to Nehru place Delhi service centre where there was only one girl and one service engineer to support but 13-15 people were waiting for their turn. It was a very pathetic experience. Due to too much of work load that girl was not even paying heed towards customer's problems. By the way it was not her fault since she was overloaded. I spent 35,000 for this phone but this is of no use for me now. I suggest not to burn your money on this phone.

Even a 10k phone is far better because you would not want to waste precious recordings of your best moments just because of a pathetic sound issue. Please avoid this phone!!!

One fine day I open to clean it and to my surprise, the rear glass is broken. I'm shocked and I'm left wondering how this happened. So I contact OnePlus, book an appointment and walk in to a OnePlus store in Hyderabad. So the guy tells me, I'm sorry Sir, but this model is prone to damage there's nothing we can do. I said the phone is 3 months old, how can you NOT be showing me any form of customer care at all? He says it's an accidental damage and warranty will not cover it. I walk out telling him, yes it is damage, but there was no accident, just poorly build quality. And oh, the camera image quality is nothing compared to a Pixel or an iPhone X. Pathetic portrait mode too. Just blurs everything around the subject, like that's supposed to make it look dramatic.

8928,"Earlier, I was using a Samsung Galaxy J7 with 1.5 GB ram. To install and use a new app, one app needed to be deleted.
I have heard a lot about One Plus mobiles and decided to give it a shot. Glad I made the choice.
Things you get along with device is Dash Charger, screen-guard on the screen and a plastic cover.
The look and feel of the device are amazing. Midnight black comes with a classy matte finish. It is somewhat slippery to handle. The plastic cover is good for protection but if you don't like it you might need to spend 1-2k extra for a cover. I bought a sandstone cover for 1k and it looks good.
The one feature which sets this phone apart is the Dash Charger: 20 minutes is all it needs to get it charged for 30-40% and for about 30 minutes it will get to 60-75% which is more than enough.
Camera quality of this phone is comparable but not better than iPhone or other devices which costs at least 20k more than this. An image clicked by an experienced photographer from OnePlus can still beat a novice to intermediate photographer's iPhone pictures.
One another Feature you get is Face Unlock which is extremely fast and you will get addicted to it. It will be difficult to use other phones which cost lower than this because you will not want to slide or enter the pin or use the fingerprint scanner to unlock the device.
You will use anything and everything for this phone instead of your laptop or tablet.
I even booked a tatkal ticket on irctc while traveling in Bangalore traffic at 10:00 am!
If you are willing to spend 35-45k on a mobile which is not going to be obsolete in at least 2 years. You should opt for this model.
Some dilemma which people face:
6GB vs 8GB
Personally, I think 8GB should be preferable not for gaming but. We can't be sure whether 6 GB would be sufficient RAM after 2 years of time. I don't play mobile games but bought 8GB model just because 6GB might be normal after 2 years.
Space: 64GB vs 128GB vs 256GB
Provided that this model does not have an sd card slot, you will be stuck with whatever model you choose.
64GB is way too low for this phone because of a single recording or some pictures might take a couple of GB. Also, you get 52GB usable space which might not be sufficient. Hence you should either go with 128 or 256 variant.
128 is the most optimal choice and one should go for 256 only if following is the case:
1) You take a lot of pictures and videos, travel a lot, and don't believe in storing those in the cloud.
2) You watch tv shows and movies downloaded on your laptop and watch it on mobile.
Example:- My brother has a 64 GB variant of Samsung mobile, 2 complete courses from coursera and a couple of videos, photos that he clicked used 48-50 GB of storage space. (85-90% of available)
Amount:- 2 complete courses 200 video lectures and family video recording short clips
Whereas in my 256 GB model even if I have entire One Piece of 800 episodes i.e. 90-120GB it will still be around 50% of storage space.
You can spend extra 5-10k on storage once, but no matter what you do you can't expand the memory to 128 or 256 after you made the purchase. Hence I would recommend deciding accordingly which suits your requirement.
The only negative point is they could have included earphones with this but sadly they have not.
Overall:- I was satisfied with the purchase I made from Amazon Prime(which gave me the subscription to one-two day delivery in metro cities and Amazon video content)","episod,year,shoot,storage,movie,memory,minut,ticket,devic,purchase,sandstone,video,laptop,choice,guard,everythe,oneplu,content,subscription,day,show,card,person,tatkal,extra,photographer,feature,case,midnight,family,look,course,camera,amazon,unlock,couple,lecture,device,app,pin,ram,time,dilemma,screen,irctc,thing,anyth,coursera,record,galaxy,scanner,piece,phone,space,cloud,finish,traffic,brother,lot,earphon,mobile,fingerprint,tablet,slot,quality,picture,point,photo,metro,protection,black,charger,plastic,iphone,face,game,model,requirement,variant,cover,bangalore,image,dash,novice,delivery,clip,citi"

8945,"One of the best phone in today's time in this price range. The flagship phone of Oneplus, OnePlus 6 comes with a dash charger which is fastest charging technology. The camera is great and you can record videos in 1080p 4k videos with 60 fps. Selfie camera has also been improved slightly and comes with the beauty mode. There is face unlock which is really fast and doesn't take even a second to recognise your face. Fingerprint sensor is below the camera which is uncomfortable at starting but you will get used to it. Battery was draining in Android 8 but after the update of Android 9, this issue is resolved. The phone has a 8GB RAM and 128GB internal storage (though it also has a 6GB + 64GB). You can use as many as 40-50 apps at a time (in the background) without any lag.

Low ligh images are good , under light conditions it's probably one of the best ones in the market. New updates rolled out with Android pie(love it) security patches every month and the major plus point would be the battery life. It senses your app usage and optimizes the phone accordingly. Single charge on a heavy use can last upto 6hrs on full on screen time, average usage gives about 24hours(mobile data on, social networking apps running ), if you're a light user, it'll last around 36hours. Charging is quick(very). Only let down would be the speakers on the piece, they're loud but do not get that good feel. Could've been better at this price range. Too much volume can cause distortion and they don't feel good to the ear. Apart from that absolutely the speed you need♥️
PS: I'm using a 6gb ram version and tested it along side 8gb ram, they have the same performance just that the 128gb storage additional.

It's really so beautiful. I have used many Android smartphones in past like HTC, Lenovo, moto, and most of them Samsung but from now I'm oneplus fan because of its sexy look, cool design, awesome display, extra ordinary camera and great performance speed.🤟
It's really so fast like 'speed you need' and best value for money.
I have couple of suggestions for oneplus.
1) Improve camera provide stickers and filters options. Animoji will be great if you can include that.
2) I know oxygen Os is itself awesome and well customized but it'll be great if you add your own OnePlus theme store like HTC and Samsung where users can customize their smartphone with more themes and wallpapers.
If you can provide these updates then I'm sure most of Samsung and other smartphone users will not gonna stop themselves to being OnePlus family :)
I hope you'll consider my opinions.

9212,"Oneplus has come far down the road providing great smartphones at half the cost of what other smartphone comoanies are charging. This is my second one plus & I'm not at all disappointed by my choice after shifting from iPhone 7. So let's begin with the review. My review is based on after & before getting the Android Pie update & using it for nearly 2 month or so.
Cons
- I really hoped that oneplus should have given me IP rating for the cost they are charging. Had high hopes after coming from iPhone 7.
- Camera quality is good. But not great. Pictures turn out to be soft even I'm now running on android pie official version. It's kind of a let down for the price as even Samsung & MI phones are delievering great image quality without softing the image.
- Another let down for me is that OP6 doesn't has stereo sound. I don't want to say that sound quality is bad; infact it's great but having dual speakers could have been great! (Helps me to watch late night movies over phone)
- Okay! So this one is personal. I really don't know how to set keyboard shortcuts. But I would really like OP to provide us keyboard shortcuts in their own launcher. Like in iPhone I could quickly type in a shortcut as fb & the whole word facebook would come in.
- I really wished for a 2k display but HD+ is also acceptable. But the fact that they are not using fully Amoled panels like in Samsung devices is a let down for me. I really love the Samsung Amoled display. They are the best when it comes to screen quality & color rendition.
- After Android Pie update; I really hate that we have to click the 3 dot icon over the recent apps to lock, use multi window etc! I would really like OP to work on this & provide us a better solution to lock out apps from recent apps menu & use multi window.
Pros
-Battery life for me before & after the Pie update has been just exceptional. Dash charging is best in business since my last use of OP3. I game a lot. Based on playing Pubg, Pes18, Modern Combat 5. The battery life has been great. Despite dropping to 88% from 100% after playing one classic match in Pugb; dash charging charges the phone in no time & later I can go on for my work.
- Customisation is on whole new level. If you're iOS user & use this there is world's difference. I really like how I can customise my DND settings, icons, homescreen etc.
- Finger Print scanner & face ID works like a charm. They unlock so fast that I'm barely able to look my notifications over the lock screen.
- Alert slider is the best thing which has come to android i.e in OP. I really liked iPhone's mute switch & on android side I suppose only oneplus has done it which is just amazing as one doesn't even need to pull down their phone notification to mute it during important meetings.
This review is based on both Android Oreo & Pie updates. I was very much suprised when I got the Pie update. Though it has minor bugs but those will be fixed soon in the next update.
I really like how people say iOS being simplistic; but on android side OP has yet again proven that my switching from iOS to android again is not a regretfull decision.
For people who are trying to decide between OP6t & OP6 I would say OP6 is better choice if you are willing to sacrifice headphone jack then sure go ahead. And people who are looking to upgrade from OP3/3t this is the right one. Those who already own OP5/5t jumping to OP6/6t won't be wise decision since oneplus is already supporting android pie updates till OP3! Another 6 month wait & you might get a great phone! Who knows!?

Initially I had a few issues with the GPS of this device - all location related apps would not work, but after the Android P update, things are fine.
Overall, a fairly powerful phone in all respects. Camera effects are also nice. But even with a configuration of this kind, some apps hang or crash.
Another issue is that the free Sandstone black cover that was part of the deal got cracked within 7 days of use - with just regular use - no hard impacts at all.
Some of the basic things are surprisingly good - because these days a lot of manufacturers are focusing on fancy stuff but ignoring basic things like call quality etc. But in this phone, call clarity is amazing. And the speaker of this phone is simply outstanding - very loud and clear when using it for conference calls. Battery life has also been quite satisfactory so far.
Overall, a great buy, but some small issues still remain - and the quality of the back cover is really low - deducting one star for that.","android,quality,issue,conference,kind,etc,clarity,week,crash,effect,call,location,phone,back,deal,manufacturer,use,camera,update,device,app,part,lot,battery,sandstone,cover,speaker,life,configuration,stuff,day,star,respect,thing,buy,impact"

- Battery backup is good, has 25-30% juice left by end of day under normal usage (Calls, 4g, WiFi, Bluetooth, gaming etc combined).
- Dual 4G Volte is supported.
- Display can be very bright and colors are vibrant. Not less than any premium display.
- Oxygen OS as fast and snappy as ever. Updates and patches are on time
- I use Airtel and Jio, full signal bars most of the volte.
- Crystal clear voice when calls are connected over volte in HD.
- Excellent Camera and OIS.
- Above average design but not unique.
- Medium size notch
- Blocking bottom speaker will not cut off sound completely.
- Soft Back cover, Screen guard came along.
- Dash charger works like it did for previous ones.
So one can't go wrong at all with this One unless you get a faultly piece. But I am worried that I don't feel I am getting enough for its price vs what OnePlus 1 or even OnePlus 3 offered for their price.
Ofcourse every year OnePlus will come out with latest processor and will definitely have Oxygen OS with steep increase in its pricing but that is not what I can say as 'Never Settle'. Maintaining just standard level of latest specs doesn't match its motto. Need something extra, something unique, out of the box kind that others can't even think to offer to bring that excitement back and to justify increase in price. Adding features piece by piece with every 6 month is not very compelling.
Now even good brands are coming up with similar specs in similar or lower price.
Before this I got to use Asus Zenfone 5z for few months and I must say it was awesome. Charged as fast as OnePlus, has Dual Volte, their Zen UI is as fast and snappy as Oxyzen OS but at the same time their are lot features inbuit like Phone Manager. Display is less bright but more punchy, Camera is not as good as that of OnePlus 6 but the secondary camera really bring some difference by wide angle shots. AI feature they use is helpful in many things charging slowly overnight and increasing battery life or in short everything I could think of I needed after coming from OnePlus 5 was available and much more. I am not saying it was perfect, face unlock was very slow and didn't work most of the times but still it had FM radio, came with a nice earphone and after having these all it is priced 5k less, weights 20g lesser and heavy discount are available on it from time to time.
I really hope OnePlus does something different in future release or it will be taken over by good brands offering more in less price.","bluetooth,premium,year,box,shot,kind,backup,oxygen,spec,airtel,motto,difference,patch,notch,feature,radio,piece,charger,color,call,volte,phone,size,back,one,earphone,month,camera,zenfone,sound,angle,face,update,unlock,game,wifi,manager,zen,juice,voice,oxyzen,weight,someth,lot,battery,medium,increase,cover,crystal,display,time,speaker,life,design,usage,screen,guard,oneplu,end,other,dash,bar,level,everythe,asu,release,price,processor,day,signal,thing,discount,brand,excitement"

9531,"If you're looking to replace an OP3 or 3T, or any year-and-a-half or older phone. With the OnePlus 6 you'd be getting a solid all round camera experience, a display that's better than most, and software that's feature-rich, plain and fast all at the same time. Plus battery life that may not be class leading, but charging tech that is.
Pros
The increased price is still much lower than current top-end phones
Super fast charging, good battery life
Oxygen OS has a stock look, but offers more features, and is blazing fast
The improved primary camera kinda makes up for the meaningless secondary one

The over all performance of this fon is just amazing 😍 thanks to the SD845 chip and 6GB ram... The manual control of the camera is just dope.. The ability to shoot raw with this Phones makes me like it even more... The dynamic range of the camera is amazing at this price range... The 4k recording at 60 fps is just jaw dropping 😍😍 though it does 240 fps in 1080p, I prefer 4k in 60fps for that extra crunch in the quality... But its good to know if does 240fps in full HD.. Might come in handy.. I just stepped into videography and I am loving the quality of this phone... U can check its cinematic footages output in youtube @Jaywrat Binnani
Over all I am satisfied with this phone and its camera.. Just one thing I did not like was its dual camera implementation.. I wud have liked if there was a telephoto or an ultra wide angle 2ndary lens instead of that gimmicky fake DOF creating sensor, which btw can be achieved with a single camera these days too 😇😇 otherwise I love it.!","footag,quality,dope,record,ability,photographer,note,performance,thank,phone,range,the,camera,angle,good,youtube,videographer,implementation,pro,len,crunch,drop,redmi,fon,chip,word,output,videography,binnani,telephoto,price,jaw,day,sensor,control"

9538,#thespeedyouneed It's just opposite of this tagline. Sharing very honest review here for OnePlus 6. It's not worth for 36k as it doesn't have flagship camera as well as 6 GB RAM also gives you lacking problems and hanging problem. Oxygen OS updates are very slow and doesn't work with Android properly. But phones battery backup is too good and fast charging gives you more relaxation during travelling. But overall OnePlus needs to improve this variant a lot.

9558,"Bought this phone about a month ago and this is my opinion after using it for a month.
I was using iOS since oast 9 years. The inly reason I sticked to iOS for son long is it's stability over the android. However, after seeing the features and advancement of android over iOS since past couple of years, I decided to switch it to Android. Just I had question about the hardware configuration. Hence, I wanted the best hardware configuration for my device which eliminate all the slowness possibilities for Android device.
About hardware:
The outer case is premium in feel and touch. The display ratio to body is perfect. You won't notice any borders as such on all corners. Display is pretty vivid and touch is suoer responsive. The device feels sturdy enough to handle small and medium impacts. The side buttons are easy to operate and does not feel too soft or too notchy either.
Camera:
Camera is not super but definitely a good one. There are lot of ootions in Pro mode just like we get un DSLR. You can set everything custom as per your requirement like focus, aperture, ISO, shutter soeed etc which eill results in very customisable photos.
Sound and Microphone:
Siund at loudspeakers are perfect and audible even in crowded places. Earpiece for calling fullfills the expectatios. Since Oneplus dies not provide the headphones in box, you can use any 3.5 mm headphones. I am using Apple earpods with thus device with no issues for music and calling and the music experience is not different than any iOS device.
Battery backup:
I simoly love the dadh charging technology of this device. It charges uoto 40 prr cent of battery just in 10 minutes. Overall battery backuo is upto the mark. A single charge will be sufficient with heavy internet usage for a day.
Overall performance:
Yes. This device does heats up a bit when you play any high end games for approx 30 minutes which is very natural as you are using all it's components at extereme levels for better gaming experience. But again, even the battery performance is suoerb for gaming too.
Few areas for improvement:
There are some areas in terms of user UI experience which Oneplus needs to improve a bit. Like other Android devices, this also keeps a lot of garbage files on you ROM which you need to clear time to time. Of course, it won't cause any slowness but it will definitely occupy a space on your ROM.
FINAL verdict:
I woukd definitely recommend this device because even other high end Android devices does not cone uo with such configuration at this orice tag. Snapdragon 845 with 640 GPU packed with 6/8 GB RAM is an astonishing combination in this price bucket.","year,issue,cent,advancement,suoerb,button,slowne,improvement,minut,opinion,month,shutter,garbage,devic,corner,suoer,soee,earpod,question,place,bite,everythe,oneplu,ootion,day,backuo,rom,android,technology,eill,premium,side,box,file,microphone,extereme,internet,touch,feature,case,hardware,apple,gpu,charge,course,reason,camera,sound,couple,device,uoto,ratio,user,body,ram,time,siund,prr,bucket,tag,price,orice,custom,iso,music,focu,backup,stability,expectatio,heat,performance,phone,earpiece,space,mark,lot,border,display,aperture,configuration,impact,term,fullfill,photo,combination,call,experience,verdict,game,possibilitie,headphone,requirement,feel,dslr,mode,battery,area,component,usage,level,dadh,end,loudspeaker,snapdragon,son"

Pros:
1. Battery life is good, if not playing very heavy games, battery will run for more than 24hours.
During night(8 hours) hardly 2% is decreased with wifi on.
2. Gaming mode, reading mode, alert slider are added usefull features. I use them alot.
3. Phone is waterproof, i used this phone under a waterfall near ooty. No issue at all, camera was working fine no issue after that. Just kept phone in sun for 2 mins to make it dry.
4. Hardware is strong and non-delicate inspite of mirror back. I dropped this phone 5-6 times already, no issue no dents till now. Thanks to oneplus sandstone cover as well.
4. Camera is one of the best i used so far. Pro mode is all magic. Selfie cam improved since last update.
Cons
1. Audio is ok ok. Though depends on earphones you are using. Speaker audio is just fine, anyways who likes to listen to songs on phone speakers. I use earphones or BT speakers.

9670,"Product itself is amazingly good for the price, but we can see where it excels and where it has indeed cut corners. Camera quality is still not upto flagship level, but definitely improved over previous gen Oneplus devices,Daylight shots are crisp and retain lot of details but when it comes to low light it contradicts. Oneplus has to go long way to achieve flagship level camera performance specially in low light scenarios it is very much evident with grainy images and subject does not seem to be properly highlighted. Battery life is another grey area it needs to improve big time, one could just do away for a whole day on moderate usage but still one needs to be very resourceful while using for entire day, specifically when you are heavy cellular data user, despite of all sorts of optimization you might need to charge at the end of the day. If you are a heavy user then in mid day, you might want to carry your dash charger along. Performance is perhaps the key ingredient of Oneplus, it shines here and is blazingly fast, Oxygen OS is quite snappy with any sorts of apps n games. Also another thing to consider, frequency of updates is really good, so you know your device is improving all the time. Dash charge helps to replenish the battery quickly, is one of the fastest charging standards around for a smartphone, comes in very handy on occasions you forgot to charge your phone and have just few mins to spare. Build quality is perhaps another area where Oneplus has worked a great deal to make it look more premium device and it does indeed feels great in hand and weight seems to be rightly balanced, with right blend of solid design and great asthetics, certainly justifies its price upgrade over previous generation. Amoled panel is of really good quality with dynamic range of colors without any prominent colour shift, one would thoroughly enjoy media consumption on it, as well as Outdoor visibility is also really good, no issues here wigh brightness levels. Sound quality via single loudspeaker is disappointing though, and seems lacking body to its sound n loudness level seems just average at best. As a part of promotion Oneplus 6 is providing free sandstone cover but the seller( Rocket kommmerce LLP is not shipping one here, and on query is not taking any responsibility for it either and blaming Amazon fulfillment service for it, if one doesn't get it. It should not be such a big issue afterall to ship a simple cover as even official Oneplus 6 india site is giving it away for free, I would recommend to buy from Oneplus 6 official site and not from here).","quality,colour,media,asthetic,shift,flagship,issue,llp,shot,standard,loudne,oxygen,responsibility,visibility,promotion,kommmerce,generation,optimization,ingredient,performance,color,brightne,charger,phone,daylight,consumption,charge,deal,range,the,min,camera,amazon,sound,update,blend,service,game,devic,upgrade,device,app,product,rocket,corner,india,weight,smartphone,frequency,part,lot,battery,afterall,area,sandstone,sort,datum,user,body,subject,seller,cover,query,time,image,light,design,life,level,usage,dash,oneplu,end,site,loudspeaker,hand,price,panel,day,scenario,occasion,way,detail"

And now let's talk about performance, no hiccups, not a single frame drop in games, apps just opens up when you tap on the icon. It makes life so simple. And after using this phone for a couple weeks I used a friend's Galaxy S8 and was shocked to see how Samsung and it's bloatware filled ROM slows thier phone down drastically.

9920,"I bought this phone almost 3 months ago and I think I am eligible to write a review for One Plus 6. Let's talk about some Pros First :
1) Great Display And Looks. Glass Back is very premium looking.
2) The Performance is Insanely Good
3) The Camera Quality Is Pretty Nice. Both front Camera and Rear.
4) The EIS and OIS ensures a very stable video
5) Fast Charging is so amazing. I was shocked when I first saw this device getting charged so fast. Definitely one of the best features of this phone.
6) The face unlock is fast too but I don't use it much. However, the fingerprint scanner is quick and that's something I use on a regular basis. The face unlock doesn't really work in low light conditions so you won't be able to unlock your phone in dark unless you've enabled the flash which only makes the process a lot longer than just using fingerprint scanner or a pattern.
Now to the Cons :
1) Even though it looks very premium, the glass back seems to be really fragile. You don't really want to drop this phone without a cover on it otherwise that glass back may get some cracks in it.
2) The video recorded from front camera is great but you can't use it if you want to record yourself playing a guitar and singing ( Or doing some other similar activity). The noise cancellation makes the audio really terrible.
3) I feel like they should've made some efforts on Audio. Audio feels a bit less clear from the Mono Speaker given that even less expensive phones give a better audio output.
That's it. There's not much to complaint about OP6 and so far I'm loving this phone. The speed is amazing and the looks are great.
Advice for you people who will buy it : Please use Official Tempered Glass ! I ordered a fake one before and it was bad. Dust entered the glass and in front of Camera. So I had to order an official one.

9981,"Hi,
This review is after almost 1 month of use.
I am a typical iPhone user since iPhone 4.
Thought of trying one plus 6 as I wanted a decent double sim phone (which was not available in iPhone).
Because of all hype about one plus 6, I choose to go for this against Samsung’s Note 8.
To my surprise, I got faulty phone, whose mike was not working and when I restarted the phone the phone did not start again at all.
After struggling and escalating the issue for about 10 days got the replacement.
Replacement phone is working fine.
Display is very good, battery life is decent. Sound is average. Picture quality is very good (very bright and detailed) (Still I like day pictures of iPhone and nights pics of Pixel XL)
Speed is good ( with some random app hang issues).
Reading mode is awesome.
All other aspects of the phone are excellent (built quality etc).
But I still feel for 40K, this phone is bit expensive.
This will get a lot of competition from Poco F1, and other flag ship phones.
People with tight budget should compare well and buy.","spee,quality,picture,ship,issue,budget,person,sim,mike,note,competition,replacement,phone,night,month,use,surprise,sound,iphone,app,aspect,pic,mode,lot,battery,user,hype,display,life,review,flag,pixel,day"

Trust and honest feedback: this is one of best phone currently available in market compared to other phone in this price range even 10/15k higher cost.
Don't go behind the only hardware configuration, software is more important Nd thats where one plus scores.
Best in software, speed and usability. Absolute zero in bugs and speed lacking.
The other important aspect is its technical support. Amazing you can call them any working day from 9am to 7pm and they guide you for any problem. Even on mail i asked few queries and they responded in couple of hours with exact answer. Best in class.
Finally i recommend so many phones in market are available at cheap cost or good adds, plz dont go behind them. Simply buy this phone and forget thinking or looking any phone add for atleast next 2 years. I used one plus one for almost 2.5yrs earlier.
Gave one less star for battery as this is high speed processor hence consume battery little quickly.
May be one plus should introduce low end processing speed option for less users so as their battery can go little more or give more capacity battery in next version. But nothing as such worry about battery life.
Finally will say am happy that i choose one plus 6 and suggest you simply go with this phone without thinking much.

10305,"The phone is one of the Best in class product available out there. I have given a pros and cons for this phone below, but one of the key drawback I would highlight before we go there would be the battery life. With average usage, one would would need to charge the phone atleast twice a day. The Dash Charge definitely helps in covering up for this drawback, but still if you do not have access to the dash charge and/or you are travelling, the amount of charge that the battery holds will become an important factor.
PROS
1. The increased price is still much lower than current top-end phones
2. Super fast charging
3. Oxygen OS has a stock look, but offers more features, and is blazing fast
4. The improved primary camera kinda makes up for the meaningless secondary one.
CONS:
1. What are we to do with a claimed water resistance but no IP rating?
2. A proper telephoto/ultra-wide camera would be more useful
3. No microSD slot, no wireless charging.
4. Poor battery backup compared to many phoes available out there in the same price range.","backup,oxygen,feature,phone,resistance,amount,charge,look,cla,kinda,range,atleast,camera,rat,con,stock,product,pro,phoe,acce,factor,battery,life,dash,usage,water,end,telephoto,price,day,drawback,slot"

One thing that I don't like is the battery life, it's really low , I have to charge it twice a day. It won't last more than 10 hours of normal usage. even if you just keep it idle in pocket with data and gps on it will die in about 12-14 hours.","pocket,phone,power,mode,size,battery,life,hour,shot,video,datum,day,month,the,camera,screen,usage,app"

OnePlus 6's biggest omissions are wireless charging, an IP-rated weatherproof body, a high-res or HDR screen, stereo speakers, 3D face or iris recognition, AI enhancements, 960fps slow-motion, and HDR video recording.
The question then is how many of these features really matter enough for you to want to spend up to twice as much on one of those other phones? Sure, they'd be nice to have, but are you really missing out on something significant?
The OnePlus 6 is still gorgeous, extremely well crafted, supremely powerful, and fully capable of doing what most people want their phones to do.
At this price point this is the only option with a Snapdragon 845 right now. The software is both versatile and up-to-date which are both significant if you are planning to keep it for a while. This is also a phone you can show off quite proudly. I think that most people, especially OnePlus fans looking for an upgrade, will be quite satisfied with the OnePlus 6.
