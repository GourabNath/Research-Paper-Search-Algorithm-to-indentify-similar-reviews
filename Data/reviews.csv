Best phone ever,5
One of the best phone!,5
"one plus 6 is extremely worth for it's price and moreover in Amazon sale it's even beyond that. 35k for this phone is worth buying but in Amazon sale it costs me 27k. it's just mind blowing deal for me.
.
A fast device with perfect photo clicking quality. Definitely the best phone to buy",5
Good pictures,5
Six months later: no complaints. OnePlus does deploy customer centric design really well.,5
Superb,5
This is my honest review of one plus 6 and i am not even faking it please its your money i don't have to anything with it i just wanna let u know guys these devices performs best as compared to flagship phones but i am having a very bad experience after 3 months of usage.I use to play pubg on this phone but now i can see fadded icons of games like shooting button sertings button names health etc even if the game is closed i tried updating rebooting but the problems are still there and now i am planning to go to customer service of one plus.I will post the honest opinion after visiting to the customer service.,2
"One plus makes very premium quality phones we all are well aware of that. Compared to Samsung the prices are also much more sensible so but it without giving a second thought. Check video reviews on YT though, MKBHD and Unbox Therapy maybe.",5
This Is The Best Phone Ever. Smooth As Butter. After Using This Phone I Can't Use Any Other Phone.,5

Just ausome,5
Best product in good price,5
"Performance is good, but has some issues. The mobile Internet on the phone stops working and required a restart almost 3 times a day.
The people at the sales outlet at Seawoods Grand Central Mall are not even willing to talk to you. They ask you to go to the service centre. They say that they don't know technical stuff, only information for selling. They perhaps are worried about customers getting influenced by the visit of a customer who has run into problems. Instead of reassuring the customer, they keep repeating -  'Go to the Service Centre. We don't know anything.'. This is is so so sad.
The people at the service centre say that it required a factory reset as there is some OS Corruption. This is strange. Additionally, they do not even have an option to help you with your data backup.
The only good thing they had at the service centre was good coffee. The place is worth a visit only if you want some good coffee. Service is not their forte. Thank you.",4
This phone is very good;good sound quality;good features;oxygen Os is awesome;picture quality is excellent but it fades little bit in interiors;it does not hang at all very fast phone ; IAM being using it since 6 month and no issue recommend to take it,5

Very Good Deal,5

You should have one +,5
Good,5
3rd one plus phone for all.  great performance as always :),4
One plus... Pulling strong wit its amazing Specifications.,5
Yet another masterpiece from one plus. Been using from 6 months now. Handled it very rough. Installed many apps and games. Using it heavily and havent noticed little lag or any problem so ever. No lag. Does justice to the caption. Speed you need. Had issues with amazon delivery. My first order was lost in transit. Then reordered from prime now with 2 hour delivery. Now glad we have offline retail stores. Need not to rely on Amazon when they are irresponsible and lose the 30k item in transit.,5
We r happy but we have not received the Cashback into our Citi bank credit card.,4
"Superb look, awesome speed and value",5
Nic,5
Very happy with this product,4
Camera is Best,5
overall  okay,5
"No SMS Forwarding, No In bhoot Apps, Not able to Opn the Links in whatsapp or Message apps. Horrible Customer Care Service which is not vale to resolver any issues or answer queries. Automatic Data Loss. Bought one plus 6 64gb and it is not supporting  word, excel or pdf apps.  Not able to clear the ram automatically for all apps. They are asking to go to every app in android system n clear everything individually. Useless Phone. No usability for all above mentioned features",1
Awesome mobile,5
Expensive but overall experience is really awesome...! Worthy product,5
Very less Battery life.,1
Recommended to all who are looking for a phone in this price range,5
Battery life needs to be improved,4
"I'll be completely honest, the product is good but not something that blew me off my feet. Face recognition and finger print ID are quite fast but not perfect. Camera is good but videos below full HD seem to be of lower quality than they should be. Slow me video is patchy and bokeh is below average. As a new device battery life is average. I used to have a Nexus 5 and despite the ""huge"" upgrade I don't see a huge performance boost. This device even crashed several times while playing simple games. Sound quality however is one of the best any loud speaker, even if not the loudest available, is still good.",3
Super,5
"A great phone , a great price. More than happy. Should come with a better scratch  guard cover, than the one given free with it.",5
Everything is good .,5

"I shifted from iphone X to oneplus 6, & yes definitely this is really good performing device with great specs. i am already in love with this phone. awesome built quality & i really love its time to time updates.

Awesome product. Superb Camery quality. Can be easily compared with iphone.,5
Wow the only word..,5
"After about 6 months of usage, I am finally ready to share my experience of using this device. Build quality is totally amazing. Camera is good and the processor (Snapdragon 845) is the best processor available in the market today. As always, Dash Charge technology of OnePlus is supremely fast and can provide a day's worth of charge in just 30 minutes (literally). Battery backup is awesome even if you are a heavy user and does not disappoint you at any point in time. Display quality is also excellent and does it's job perfectly.
In the end, everything about this phone is premium and I am very much satisfied with my purchase.",5
just one drawback is oneplus 6t came too soon,5

This thing just happened last month. My phone fell down flat from a height of around 4 foot on floor and the display got cracked and it costed me 8K for the repair as it was a physical damage which doesn't count in the warranty. The saddest part was the tempered glass fixed on the screen was all safe but the original screen got damaged. Gorilla glass ? Really ?,5

I bought one plus 6. 8gb ram 256 gb storage for 39000 at one plus authorized store in Hyderabad a week ago I have bought it. But online the price is high,5
Excellent,5
"Pros
1. Exteremley fast user interface and navigation. No hanging, heating up while using multiple apps.
2. Quick updates from OnePlus. (Pie, Security patches etc)
3. Camera very good. However for night photos one might want to use Google Camera app with Nightsight. Video recording is decent as well in bright light.
4. All heavy games such as Pubg, Asphalt 9 run in high resolution.
5. Sound quality is good but struggles a bit for loudness especially if you have high impedance Earphones.
Cons:
1. No memory card slot
2. No stereo speakers
3. No IP certified for water resistance
4. Battery life is ok. Though charging is fast.
Overall its an excellent phone 4.5/5",5

I don't write the specifications n all.... The lot of taarif already out there. The one thing I just want to say, I go with OP6 even OP6T is available and also with so many offers it is better than OP6T. When I pay the almost same amount though I don't get 3.5 headphones jack, the notch (I like it) nd the fingerprint scanner. Only disappointed is the price....wwwhh if I get some offers, Who get they are lucky.",5

"My OnePlus 6 device is not working properly since purchasing on 19th Aug'2018, which cropped up major problem since Nov'2018.
Every call is cracked, making conversation impossible, camera flash & torch not at all working, overall horrible experience. I took the device  to authorised service center in Guwahati twice on 19.11.2018 & 24.12.2018 without any improvement. Took up the matter with customer care and on their advice booked pick up & drop repair service on 31.12.2018. But ,it was not picked up till 4th Jan'2019 & on complaint to customer care, I was asked to recreate the request on 4th Jan'2019. Even after second request on 4th Jan'2019, the set is not picked up till 12th Jan'2019, despite everyday mail & call to Oneplus customer care & repair service agency Servify.com. Its totally horrible & frustrating experince.for me, a loyal customer earlier set being Oneplus 3. Despite all these , the customer care is not entertaining my requst for replacement .
All these put up for valued intending customers for information only.",1

OnePlus 6 is the best mobile i have ever owned.....,5
OnePlus 6 is supper awesome. Pixel quality is superb. Both front and back cameras are truly amazing. It takes stunning pictures. Battery life is also good. Amoled display takes a lot of battery that's the reason you get superb pixel quality. However if you keep the theme on dark mode the battery will last a little longer. It can last upto 20-24 hrs of normal usage and 12-14 hrs of heavy usage. Audio quality is best among all the mid range premium smartphone.,5

"The battery life is really bad, apps crash often, the sound is okay. Though the camera is really good.
But that isn't the primary function of a phone.",1
"This is really a beast in performance and flagship killer phone.
Performance - I'll give 10/10 with 8GB of RAM with SD845. I'm writing this after 3 months of usage till now I didn't saw any sluggishness
Picture - 8/10 at first picture not that much great but after some days of usage I guess AI started working & picture comes at their best. Night or low light photography have lot of scope for improvements
Software - 9/10 perfect software on top of latest Android very light & useful.
Battery life - 9/10 I usually get 24 hours of juice in a single charge with all time internet access and normal usage. On heavy usage it still provide us 8-9 hours of battery life. Dash charger is perfect it only take 1.30hr to fully charge phone from 18-20% to full 100%.",5

I have been using the one plus 6 for last 5 month with the back cover comes along with the phone and today as opened the back cover saw that there are some spots where the colour is gone. Its not good after spending  40k if you have expierence this kind of thing. And the worst part is even after using the back cover if it happens then its not worth busying. I dont know how its with mirror black. Rest camera and sound and performance is good.,1
"This is a first time that I'm buying a one plus model and after it's usage for 6 months and counting I'm very much satisfied to experience the best premium quality smartphone which offers at par to Apple brands!

Cons:-
3300 mah battery could have been better but i heard they increased it to 3700 mah in one plus 6t so its actually not the con now.
hope this will help.",5

"I may not be the right person to post a review for this phone however, I have received the review from the person for whom I bought it and I got the stats from the international survey as well. The phone justifies the subject of this review but there will always be the people switching from android to iOS, vice-versa rarely happens but according to survey 21% of iOS users have switched to one plus this year which is quite astonishing figure. I don‚Äôt want to stretch out my review now as I myself use iOS device so just one advice there is a higher version of this phone in the market right now so better check that out before purchasing this version.",5
"In just 3 months my OnePlus 6 is starting Display issue. When i get down the Brightestness level, that time suddenly display light is started vibrating like Markury, it's my fault i couldn't bought the protection plan. Now i am feeling cheated by OnePlus.",2

Nice product,5
Very good phone,5
"Picture quality is excellent.
Sound quality could be better. Compared to Moto G5+, my earlier phone, this is not up to the mark.
The battery life is excellent. Gives more than 10+ hours life even with constant use.",5
battery backup is not good after updating the phone as earlier the screen on time used to be 6-7 hrs after heavy usage but now it is only 4 to 4.5 hrs.,4
"No need to say much, it's OnePlus 6, c'mon, it's an awesome phone, it's looks, camera, screen quality, ram and smoothness, sound quality, everything is just great.",5

"Undoubtedly one of the best phones I have had.
There is no lags even when you run high graphics game, battery is way too good it charges to 100% in just 20 minutes.
And you certainly don't need a DSLR camera when you have OnePlus, it delivers striking images.",5

It is a very nice mobile packed with everything which will fullfill all your requirement.,5
Nice product.I liked it.Price worthy,5
Good,5
working nicely,4
One plus always surprises us with its camera quality and fast processings and this phone is one of its best example for high end phones.,4
Initial I faced no problem with the device but after using it for 4 months it starts not responding to some commands given. One more thing which is very annoying is a crackling sound coming from back side of the phone while the vibration is on.,1
Nine,5
Significantly better than iPhone - thank God! As I was very hesitant to make a switch after 7 years with iPhone (also didn't wanted to wait for 6T launch).,5
Great phone I ever had. Everything is perfect. No complaints yet. Simply amazing. Its been 3-4 months. 5 stars for this,5
Good,4
I bought it for 40000. Expensive but good. May not be good for that amount. Around 30K is ok.,4

"My phone has crashed. I had been facing problems since last 15 days now, and now it has crashed. I need urgent help.",1
The only part I dislike about this phone is that It clicks raw picture..however everything else is awesome it is clearly worth your money,5
I live it fully,3
Sound is loud but it hurts our ears...except that every thing is super fine..delivery is not that great beacuse as i have bought in offer season the delivery guys were not at all handled with care.,5
Super mobile,5
Excellent,5
I love one plus 6,5
Perfect picture,5
"After using it for 3months, not at all satisfied. What disappointed me most: display- forget using in sun, even build or inside room cause reflections, 2nd- user experience, OS- not friendly, then picture quality-pretty average even in comparison with opportunity, Samsung. Only more GB of RAM doesn't make good phone. Only hype and marketing gimmicks...",2
Fastest phone ever,5
"This phone is beast.
Speed performance all is just superb",5
Sound quality is fine... Volume is slightly low.,5
Better than any other phone at this price,5
Battery type should be developed. Picture quality is good. Sound also good. Battery life should be developed. But overall it's good.,5
"It's not even 3 months since I have been using this phone. The device has stopped working with my Vodafone sim card but works fine with Airtel. My Vodafone sim works fine in other devices, my family members on Vodafone have no issues with Vodafone network at the same location, and the problem happens everywhere, not just a specific area. I tried all the reset and reboot options possible and even lost data from my phone. Nothing seems to be working. I will definitely not be going for a One Plus ever again after this experience.",1
Excellent performance,5
A good smart phone in premium segment.,4
Phone is very good but amazon app is bad the service man has told that i will get cashback of 2400 but i havent got now they are telling cashback will not be provide very bad app i doesnot like,5

All good,5
Good product,5
"the phone is good for the given price. and yes, it is fast.",4
"First of all thanks to you @Amazon  for such blaze fast delivery, now about the phone it's truely gem of device.
I got it in great Indian sale in which it was priced @Rs 35000 or so don't remember exactly but eventually it came down to 33k with SBI debit card.
But there still is a catch cuz it came with an year screen replacement warranty although it's 3rd party subscription but who cares untill you're getting paid to crack your own screen (within the insurance period). But don't take it seriously guys always use a back cover.
Now about the device this is really a beast of a phone ..
Powerapcked performance with a SD 845 and 8gb of Ram as well as 128gb of memory.
No so ever lag whole playing PUBG in ultra HD and fram rate set to highest. Thumbs up for that.
Camera is quiet good as well as ...
But don't take it otherwise one might still struggle to take good portraits with bokah effect.
If you're familiar with photography (i.e. are able to use and understand Manual mode then u already are a winner).
Note - for pro user ( the iso bar doesn't start from 50, it starts from 100) .
Speaker is loud enough and good. But not that gr8
UI - who doesn't love stock rom if u r one of em then guy u have a serious problem üòÖ . P.s. just kidding. But stock rom makes it bloatfree and smooth as butter.
Note. Would have liked a custom music player with advanced settings such as toggles, bass controller,etc..
If u are an audiophile then you will get adequate quality of sound through earpiece but it's not as much as great as tgat found on LG devices (p.s. upgrading from lg g6).
Design - Cool ergonomic design with a slight curved at back making it easy to hold. The body is beautiful AF. P.s. got a mirror black variant but is smudge prone would recommend to keep a wipe cloth always with you if you really are planning to buy this to flaunt otherwise a pre provided case would do.
We get a charger, a case , and an ejector (sim card) along with ghe handset.
Charging is awsome as usual with 1+ devices and can charge device quickly even though one is playing pubg on full brightness and highest setting. Hats off to 1+ for that.
So signing off with that remark.
If u liked it pleas upvote it
Thanks.",5
One of the best phones in the market ...great quality.,5

Dash charge rocks",5

Certainly a beast. The camera is stunningly superb.,5
Awesome Awesome Awesome. Beautiful notch. The midnight black variant is amazing to touch with bare skin.,5
"Happy to receive the product in a day Amazon big sale. Quite late for a review. The product is well built. People look for 3 things. Performance, Camera and Battery. One plus scores heavily on Performance and Camera, however battery life doesn't enough to hold the performance it provides. As sidekicks, RAM management, Storage management is good. UI is very good and stock androish. Sound is loud, but the output is terrible for its premium charging. Dash charger is very good to charge your mobile as quick (if its switch off then its super fast charging). Overall, for its budget, its providing the value at it best with very few give ups...",5
Superb phone with best features.speed is definitely the plus point. Camera can be a ted better but overall i am happy with the purchase.,5

Picture quality is awesome. Display is also good. Fluid os. Only drawback is battery life. But it's average.,5
Camera quality is so bad. I have stopped doing video call with this phone. Just because I could not return it back it within the return periin have to face the consequences of it. Very bad canera quality. Will never suggest anyone to buy one plus phones.,2
The phone is exceptionally good and meets all expectations of any flagship phone. I am writing this after one month usage. There are no issues even today and the phone's performance is as it was on day 1.,5

Fastest ram ever before,5
"The phone is undoubtedly best in its price range but the only con I found to be annoying is that the battery drains like juice during usage. Just one PUBG game and the battery falls down by almost 20%. So it is annoying during travelling. But luckily the dash charger provided with the phone charges the phone with the same rate as it discharges. You can get upto 25-30% in just 20 minutes. So it is not a problem until we have a plug point to plug in the dash charger. But if you need to charge the phone using some power bank, it takes some considerable time to get charged.....",5
Taking the standards of mobile to another level.. clarity in picture n sound.. processor is too good.,5
One of the basic function in a phone is messaging (sms).Everytime while starting the application it gets stuck.Everytime i receive a msg or try to text something the app gets stuck and it takes a good 5 to 6 seconds to work properly.I just don't understand why nowadays the software developers donot give proper attention to the basic features of a mobile phone.I have more than one phone of oneplus and very satisfied with the products but this text message application problem is present in the devices.,5
I'm simply loving this mobile,5

"I bought this phone just 4 months back on Emi considering the best option in current phones, and was using it very well, and then suddenly 2 days back my phone felt into bucket filled with water, and as per committed by one plus 6 team, going with the thought that it is waterproof, i switched it on and boom the phone went off completely, when i showed it to nearest service centre they said as the water has lodged in to the ic the phone is not working and they asked me to change the Screen (Inr 10000) and Motherboard INR (22000) - Total Cost 32000, in this amount you could buy a new phone,and the denied considering any warranty for the phone as this was a case of Liquid spill... i really dont know how this service centre works, they did not even register my complaint and just told me nothing can be done.. cant imagine i just burned out 35000 in just a span of 4 months on this phone, also when the phone back cover was opned it seems to be a used one..",1

"ONE WORD REVIEW
BEAST OF SMARTPHONES
Not a day passes by when I don't forgot
To appreciate it's performance ü§©",5
"I'm using this device since last 6 month. now I'm facing lot of problem with it like hanged, slow processing, call receiving, call dialing....pls spend this amount for a genuine product....MI note 5 pro is okay better than one plus 6.",2
"After 3 months of use, i find this phone really worth it. It just need some software optimisations.
Camera- The image quality with the stock camera app is decent. However, the Gcam mod has done wonders which can be installed without root.
Speakers- People say that it's sound is tinny, but in my opinion, they perform pretty good and can handle loud background noise easily.
OxygenOS- The best thing of this phone. The light and bloatfree ui has made me fall in love with the software.
Battery- It was really a beast when the phone was on oreo. Whereas, in pie, it has degraded a bit but it can easily cut through the day with 2 charges (while playing heavy games like PUBG in my case).
Performance- No words. It handles everything you throw at it easily.
Looks- Gorgeous
Screen- It's a massive screen. Some people may find it difficult to handle but i think due to it's tall form factor and thin bezel design, it's not difficult to hold on. Moreover, the screen quality is really nice.
The last and the best. Dash charger. It can charge upto 65% in just half an hour.
I totally recommend this phone to everyone.",4
Battery life too small.,5
Awesome. I like it. The camera is amazing. The battery is also very good. üòä üëç 1+ 6 is good,5

Still overall I liked the product.",4
Brilliant phone,5
Amazing phone.,5
"Bought this one just before the relase of the 6t, so had a very good deal. Got the 256 GB variant for ‚Çπ35.5k which was very sweet.
If you ask why go for the 6 when the 6t was just a week away. I'ld say that the internals are exactly the same. So there is no upgradation on the performance stand point. The cameras are exactly the same, you do have a headphone jack which is my personal preference and also I prefer the normal fingerprint sensor that is on the back instead of the optical under the screen. The screen on the 6t is bigger by 0.1"" so that's not like a huge difference. On the notch front i'ld have preferred the tear drop shape but basically can't complain when you get such a good deal.
So decided to buy this one and got a super super super sweet deal at Amazon. Delivery was fast.
The device that we order in India is the one that's assembled in India at the Oppo Factory.",5
Super phone,5

Volume button and power button feels like seems to go off easily and not clickable,5
Worth the risk of choosing it over the 6T . Power pack phone !,5

"Why does a person have to buy an iPhone when u hv such a capable device in the market ?? its super smooth. Camera , performance, battery life is outstanding. ""Dash Charge"" is luxury. Only for 35k ??? wtf !!",5

"Got this as a birthday gift from my fiance. While the camera has an awesome clarity. Would like to caution the buyers on the substandard quality of screen, it broke off even though the phone had not fallen from my hand. Dont know how does it boast of having a Corning Gorilla Glass 6 protection when it gets damaged so easily. I am feeling really bad that I would have to Shell out money now to get the screen replaced",3
Awesome mobile,5
"No doubt...Good phone. I have seen couple of issues too, like print option not available in photo gallery, message app hangs up sometimes (not only for me, my friend also has same problem), etc. Probably, I don't agree to the statements that, One Plus is a Killer phone! Definitely falls in good phone segment.",4

I am a multitasker and only this phone can handle me. Everything is so fine and crisp. Only things which can be improved are battery life it's good & last for 9 hours after massive use but still can be improved. One more thing one plus update comes frequently that's good but it should rolled out only if fully tested. Sometime new issue comes while using due to new update,5

I liked the phone. Had been longing for one plus... Battery life is less. Earpiece volume should be more flexible. I mean the scale should have more variation. Less is not less and average is also too high. I like softer volume actually. I m not deaf.,5

"This review is about oneplus5t that I bought less than 10 months back. BASED ON THAT AND THEIR SUUPORT MECHANISM I WOULD SAY DONT BUY ANY ONEPLUS 5T. After my phone crashed i called up the support toll free number and th rep Deepak was more keen to get off the phone. Told me that company never promised easy or good support when i mentioned their lack of support centers in Bangalore and poor quality of product. He told me only way I can register a complaint was thru a android phone which I pointed out one plus 5t has crashed within 10 months. Finally he me I could raise a complaint from my laptop. Their web site for registering complaint is defective and does Not work. Perhaps that's deliberate to avoid complaint registration.  It forces one to enter location from drop down and does not go beyond that.
I am taking phone that I paid 35000 to service centre that's 2 hours away hoping thsy would repair",1

He wasn't ready to accept my phone which cleared a test on Amazon app. The call centre guy had no info about the results.
Now let's talk about the phone. Over all it's a good phone but it defeats the purpose of a cell phone. It has design flaw. The call receiving speaker is so tiny that you can forget about using this phone for calling. Rest all is good.",1

I would highly recommend this product.,5

"I have used Samsung, apple, Nokia, MI till now at least two years.  this is the first time i feel i should get rid of this phone at the earliest.  unfortunately i bought this phone one month back and made factory reset and OS installation in service center twice because of so many issues.  worst experience, i am surprised to see such a hype for this device.  heating issue, battery drains fast, few apps do not work, second sim doesnt work sometime, dual app doesnt work, hangs and behaves weird sometimes.. not reliable at all.  i paid very high price for this quality.  i have never experienced such bad experience with Sumsung and Apple so far.  Oneplus has a long way to reach their standards.",1

Good phone,5
"Everything is good about this phone, except that the good features that were there in Moto G4 are missing. I'm not talking about the brand specific features. I'm more worried about the options and settings that were available there.
1. Now There is no option to independently setup notifications per app in lock screen when phone is locked and pull down tab when phone is unlocked. In summary, lock screen is cluttered with notifications from preferred apps, while there no space for music apps for control. I gave feedback about it, but there is no response from OnePlus
2. The apps list is now tiled vertically side by side with no option available to set it like one on top of the other, like it was before. The navigation with earlier approach was very fast. Now it takes longer time to navigate through app one by one
3. Volume control is not good. It takes you to whole new page. Any video playing at that time would stop. This happens especially when I am playing video and want to turn off alarm sound or reduce ringing volume.
4. Bluetooth does not connect to already known device automatically. It it seems to take long time.
5. The gestures are not sensitive enough to work first time. It needs at least two attempts to open app through gestures on locked screen
There are many more, but this is all for now.",3
Perfect for photos lover..and good battery quality,4
Working as expected.,5
Battery life can be improved . Picture quality and Sound quality are amazing.,4

Phone as expected gives a superfast performance, best user experience, dash charging is amazing, camera is good... However, low light performance is still needs improvement even after the inclusion of nightmode. But that doesn't mean it's bad... It comes in comparison with top end flagship cameras.
Very satisfied with OnePlus and Amazon on this purchase!",5

Sound quality is ohk. It's not that much loud but it's ohk.
Game changing is battery life. If you are a normal user, then battery will last till a day. But if you are a core user, then you have to charged your phone twice a day.

Best smartphone under 35K category. Awesome speed and super fast charging.,5
First time using One+ product. I had availed Dusshera offer and mobile delivered on time by Amazon. Thanks for it. Everything was good except Battery as it was draining fast. Sleeping time was not set initially. I did the same and battery draining time has reduced. I have contacted Amazon and they had offered the service of a home Service Expert. He had come and suggested a couple of other setting changes as well which has increased the battery usage time. Now I am getting a whole day with heavy usage.  Camera is just awesome. No over heating issue. Fast charger is an additional advantage. When the battery problem had started i was bit repentant that I should have waited for 1+6T. Now I am fine as battery is giving reasonable coverage throughout the day.,4

Camera quantity is awesome which is the most highlighting feature of this phone long distant pictures are not as clear as iPhone but whatever they are giving in 40000 is excellent pictures are better than all Samsung mobiles there is no comparison in ram and speed because as one plus 6 is winnerbattery life is enough for one day use but fast charging is like best feature and if you turn on battery saver mode on then your battery will stand by today's when I am on the Himalayan Trek the phone is on flight mode my battery works for 4 days that is surprising with every day 50 clicking pictures and listening songs for 3 hours the phone is best in 40k my last mobiles are Sony Xperia z and Samsung galaxy A8,5

"It's a great phone , build quality is good I didn't expect white colour would be that good , surface finish is like white marble , looking at it at different angles gives a bluish tinge and same for the silver lines it gives a pinkish tinge , camera is superb , it can take photos (my version 8.1) as good as pixel xl 2 as I have already used one ,the best part is it's manual camera control which gives you control as similar to an professional camera. Battery last almost 1~ 1/2 - 2 days but totally depends on your usage if you can stay without additional features that are in 6t then you should get this provided if you are getting huge discount or price drop.",5
"At this price point, this is an unbeatable phone. There is very little to fault here. Amazing OS, very fast processing, ample memory and storage, a brilliant camera, excellent display, latest android 9, great community support. The only downside is the single speaker but that does little to take away from the overall experience.",5

"I purchased Oneplus 6 with high expectations as I am already using 2 and 5. Oneplus 6 is slow compared to 5. The picture quality is not natural and we have keep the screen on full brightness all the time. Because of this factor battery life is also low. I suggest the company to rethink on improving these short comings, even though I am not worth to suggest.",3
Good one... Battery life is below expectation,4
Worth of money,5
What i love the most is its speed. Camera is at par with other flagship devices. Sound output is amazing. Only one difficulty i faced is its weight as earlier i was using Nexus 5 which is only 144 grams. Rest i am satisfied with the product.,4

"I don't know this is the phone's fault or Amazon's fraud coz this phone is not at all what one plus 6 is. It hangs like anything, I can't even perform routine tasks on my phone, even phone calls get disconnected on their own. Very disappointed with this.",1
The mobile camera is awesome and design and battery are great but the sound or mobile is average,3
Nice product,5
"I don't know much about the technical stuff. As a layman, I find this phone to be stylish enough, touch response/feel is great, photos are better than what I get on my wife's iPhone, haven't felt any lagging while using different applications, be it Outlook, be it candy crush, general browsing, YouTube, WhatsApp etc etc. Sound quality on calls is really good. Ease of using the Settings and understanding the UI is pretty cool. Going by the reviews, the brand equity of the product,, and my  personal experience using it, I feel the money I spent is totally worthwhile.
The following is for Amazon-- I had to order the phone twice as my first order got cancelled and the whole experience was unpleasant. I had written a mail to customer support with all the details but I did not get any response.",5
Awwwww,5
"Unexpected slow face unlock ,the vibrate,ring,scilent button is gone ,very dissoppointing",1
"Bought this phone about a month ago in just 27999 INR (with 1000 INR Amazon pay cash back) and this is my opinion after using it for a month:
I wanted the best hardware configuration for my device which eliminate all the slowness possibilities for Android device.
About hardware:
The outer case is premium in feel and touch. The display ratio to body is perfect. You won't notice any borders as such on all corners. Display is pretty vivid and touch is suoer responsive. The device feels sturdy enough to handle small and medium impacts. The side buttons are easy to operate and does not feel too soft or too notchy either.
Camera:
Camera is not super but definitely a good one. There are lot of ootions in Pro mode just like we get un DSLR. You can set everything custom as per your requirement like focus, aperture, ISO, shutter soeed etc which eill results in very customisable photos.
Sound and Microphone:
Siund at loudspeakers are perfect and audible even in crowded places. Earpiece for calling fullfills the expectatios. Since Oneplus does not provide the headphones in box, you can use any 3.5 mm headphones.
Battery backup:
I simply love the dash charging technology of this device. It charges upto 50 percent of battery just in 10 minutes. Overall battery backup is upto the mark. A single charge will be sufficient with heavy internet usage for a day.
Overall performance:
Yes. This device does heats up a bit when you play any high end games for approx 30 minutes which is very natural as you are using all it's components at extereme levels for better gaming experience. But again, even the battery performance is suoerb for gaming too.
Few areas for improvement:
There are some areas in terms of user UI experience which Oneplus needs to improve a bit. Like other Android devices, this also keeps a lot of garbage files on you ROM which you need to clear time to time. Of course, it won't cause any slowness but it will definitely occupy a space on your ROM.
FINAL verdict:
I woukd definitely recommend this device because even other high end Android devices does not cone uo with such configuration at this orice tag. Snapdragon 845 with 640 GPU packed with 6/8 GB RAM is an astonishing combination in this price bucket.",5

"Despite the phone being good,the service is extremely poor. The charger stoped working after 25 days exactly. When i complained on amazon,they clearly shunned away from taking any responsibility and the oneplus customer care service asked me to visit their workshop which is like 200 kms aways from my place. So before you buy this product,make sure you live near to chandigarh,ludhiana or amritsar if in punjab.
All their easy service or warranty claims are false.",1
"Low light picture quality is not good, but overall phone quality is good, while capturing video on super slow motion it's gives a lag after every particular time duration",4

It is a nice phone but as compared to OnePlus 3, it is on heavier side and little thicker too.",4
Good product,5
Not better than iPhone,5
Amazing picture quality sound is best of best and battery life long long,5
"Every aspect of this phone is great. There is no negative at least from my perspective. Camera is good, speed is the absolute best, screen is sharp and bright, reception is great and there is zero bloat, it just never slows down! I would highly recommend.",5
"Pro: Beautiful and Good looking phone along with a fast processor. Face unlock and finger print reader is the fastest I have ever come across. Battery life and optimization is good. From zero to full charge usually it takes 45 minutes approximately.
Gesture control is amazing and also you can improvise the display as per your requirement. Stock Android is a big big plus for this phone
Cons: Camera is the biggest let down for me. One plus need to improve the camera.
I found Sound quality below par.
Overall I will 8.5 out of 10, at this price range this is the best samrtphone in the market.",5

"I bought it @ 27 k so keeping in mind the price of 27k , I am writing Pros & cons of this oneplus6 :
MY ONEPLUS6 CURRENT OSXYGEN OS 9.0.
PROS :
1. SPEED : YES , AWSEOME YOU GONNA LOVE IT.
2. CHARGER : Its superb , excellent ,mind blowing charge rapidly .
3. SCREEN TOUCH is overall good and buttery.
CONS :
CAMERA : Nice on paper but not on reality , pictures are not crisp sometime have oil paint effect , I think main problem is with image processing. So advise everyone no to update to os. 9.0.2 .
BATTERY BACKUP : It easily last for 1 and half day *if you dont play games as I dont play games. Otherwise for heavy user hardly 3-3.5 hours.
Sound Quality : sometime shrill at full volume.
Camera Bumper : Get scratches , so dont like it.
Now I can say this phone doesnt deserve price tag of 35k , I bought @27k so fine. In oneplus6 , OTA update plays major role beacuse camera qaulity , battery backup and performance as last upadte os.9.0.2 is worst this is the reaon I didnt upadte till now . So always check reviews before updating to latest OTA update.",3
I am a old one plus fan previously used one plus 3t and now using ome plus 6 a huge improvement and also software optimisation is best in lobe with oxygen os. Early updates are v good,5

"So I got the silk white version (8+128) for 33.5 k plus 1k amazon pay balance. So I would say that its more phone for the money.  The marginal utility of 6T vs 6 is very less plus 6 owns 6T coz it got 3.5mm jack. The only think 6T wins is battery life though the dash charging.i don't like notch so I don't like the tear drop notch on 6T too.
Installed Pixel 3 cam asap now taking incredible images.",5

REST IS BEST.",5

Picture quality is slightly above average due to over exposure
Battery life doesn‚Äôt last more than 3-4 hours continuous usage
There is nothing extraordinary
Phone is good for daily basis but if you‚Äôre thinking of comparing it iPhones then DONT iPhone Se is equally fast in gaming and sometimes faster
Thus, it‚Äôs a good phone but not for the price one plus should‚Äôve thought before placing the price tag",3
It is good but not best. Good for this price.,4
They should be given full kit like earphone and tempered glass etc .. the phone is easy to handle pretty good,5
Worth buying,5
Awesome phone nice working,5

Awesome piece it is,5
"This is the last one with 3.5mm headphone jack. The phone's performance is amazing. The battery gets charged really quickly. Imo the fingerprint reader at the back seems more convenient than in the front although face unlock work perfectly. A small negative would be the position of the camera. If I do not put a cover on the phone, the camera touches the table and may get scratches over time.",5
Awesome,5

"OnePlus is a brand now well renowned in India and their latest offering OnePlus 6 is a beast I will divide the section between pros and cons
Pros: Awesome software experience with minimal but useful customisation and regular updates which will make it better in the coming days.
Ram management is also very good as I bought 8 gb variant it can hold many application in memory for longer period
Display is bright and vivid I didn't bother about quad hd resolution full hd+ works fine for me
Build quality is very good, ultrafast fingerprint scanner and faceunlock
Dash charge is superb
Both front camera and back camera is excellent in good light and medium light condition & back camera video output is excellent and for fun there is a slomo feature @720p 480fps
Google camera. Port is working with out root
Developer develop a lot of custom ROM for this device so it is quite future proof
Cons: the bottomfiring speaker output is below average it is well balanced but lacking in volume
Both front and back camera gives an oil painting effect in human subjects in low light condition
Headphone output is very flat not to my liking
After pie update battery drainage increases a lot hope it will fixed in future update.
Hope the detail review helps, thanks.",4

5. Dash charging is awesome, it can go through your day with heavy usage with 30 mins charging.
6. Excellent camera, now nightscape feature is also provided. Though I don't find much difference in picture quality
7. Face unlock and finger print scanner are very accurate and fast.
Cons : Sound quality of the speakers is not very great, though audio jack delivers decent sound. Also due to Amo-led display, the brightness the the screen offers is slightly lesser than that offered by an LCD screen.",5

"Well, I'm writing this review after one month of purchase and usage of the mobile.
Everything seems amazingly perfect and I have used so many mobiles so far in lifting the brand's like Nokia, Samsung, Nexus, Motorola but this time the experience is amazingly awesome altogether.
Didn't find anything bad or worst about the mobile (OnePlus 6) so far, so giving it a rating of 4stars as nothing in this world is perfect and hence they launched even OnePlus 6t.
One must buy this mobile if you are a hardcore fan of videos, music, photography and games and faster and faster performance of the mobile without giving you any troubles as such.",4

1. Sound quality of the bottom speaker is average but loudness is fine and it's audible even without earphones.
2. Ear speaker produces crystal clear sound during calls and is fairly audible even in outdoors..
Rest everything is very good about this phone... Its super fast (I have 8/128 setup)... Screen is crisp but not as good as Samsung flagships... about Camera I would say potrait mode needs some software improvements... After update night mode is an added attraction...",5

"I was using iPhone for the last six years , spending more than 1 Lac on phone does not make any sense. Finally, made decision to switch to android. I have used Xiaomi also, it also has good phones but Lacks in camera quality. Both Poco F1 and OnePlus 6 are good phones. Using both phones for more than a month and satisfied with both the phones, however touch of OnePlus 6 is slightly better than Poco F1 but front camera of Poco F1 is better. Overall both are good phones but build quality, touch and back camera of oneplus 6 is superior. As of now no regret on switching to android. Since iOS is more secure , so analyzing the security aspects of android.",4

"If you are Android user, you may be comfortable with this product. But after using IOS based phones, you can easily make out the difference. The phone sound quality is having serious issues. The promiment  features like direct access of images and oter media while operating on various apps is entirely missing.
Auto brightness adjustment is aweful.",2
The sound from the speakers is not upto the mark,5

Having a good experience on a new mob!!!!,4
"Using it from more than 1 month no issue faced. Must say a complete all-rounder phone for the price I got on diwali sale after discounts & offers (23500)
1) Picture quality in daylight & in door condition very good & in low light it has improved a lot after new update
2) Sound quality via earphone is awesome with thirdparty music app, call quality is also good no issue faced but loud speaker quality is above average they could have given Stereo speaker
3 Battery life is very good in this phone consistently getting 7 to 7.5 hour SOT with wifi & close to 6 hour if use data.
Highly recommend it!!

value for money,5
Except the battery life everything is pretty much perfect,5
Nice,5
A beast,5
"I have been using this phone for over a month now.
Overall rating: 8/10
Camera: 7/10 Very good (in good lighting condition), bokeh is also Ok but not the best. But given the price, it is one of the best.
Average (in low light). You will find graininess in the pictures.
Processor/Ram: 10/10 The phone is exceptionally fast. No lag at all. Some apps may get stuck occasionally but after some updates issue resolved.
Heating: I have played pubg, recorded videos, no heating issues so far.
Build quality: 9/10 build quality is good, gives a premium feel.
Dash charge: 10/10 That's one of the highlights, it gets charged very quickly with the USB C type l
Port. But it will charge quickly only through the adapter and cable supplied along with phone.
Face unlock/ fingerprint: 9/10 Almost perfect
Sound: 8/10 It has a decent sound output, with single speaker at the bottom, although not the best.
Cons:
Phone battery has started draining quite frequently after a recent update. It need to be resolved in further update.
Low light camera is just average. Newly introduced nightscape mode has  made some improvements but still it can be better. Also have to focus well and stay still to get a clear shot. Some times it takes tine to focus as well.
Overall It is a good choice in this price range. But If you already own one plus 5T, I don't think it is good to buy this.
 If you are looking for performance with a decent camera with dash charging, go for it without any doubt.",4
It's a flagship killer.,5
I liked it,5
It's an amazing phone but in the box there is no warranty card.,5
"AS there is no provision for data card, transferring important data to PC is not smooth",4
One of the best phone in this price range....,5
Superb. picture quality is good. Battery back up alos decently good. With 4 g my phone is lasting for 12 hrs with internet usage.,5
I've been using this device since a month has been completed now and I am completely impressed by the quality of performance and software usability and Optimisation as well as the camera quality is just perfect for the price we are paying for this phone only issue which we have is not just with this phone but every phone with this snapdragon 845 like poco F1 is the normal battery life and I hope in future update it might be fixed with a update .continious usage without gaming gives full day battery life but if i do gaming and normal usage together then battery life is lasting for just half of the day but overall it's a great phone with great specifications thank you oneplus.,4
battery so low. but charger make happy.,5

"No doubt SD845 is a beast, and this phone nails it. It comes with near to stock android experience by oxygen OS which is OnePlus custom UI for years,
The phone is blazing fast and it is pretty much self explanatory. I am writing this review at the time when OnePlus 6T has been already released and this phone is equivalent to it at all terms except sound quality as it doesn't have stereo speakers.
Rest be assured, your money is not going to be wasted. Absolutely worth purchasing in 2018.",5
"What a phone!! What a phone!!
Full day battery. Lightening fast. Great speaker and screen. I had one plus one for 4 years and I upgraded it to one plus 6. My one plus one was still working like a charm when I upgraded :)",5

Need to improve battery life.",5

I was hyped when I received it. After a few days of usage... I submerged it under water. Twas my bad. Now, the screen is gone, sound clarity not as before. The phone is slow. Touchscreen not working. SIM reader affected.
My advice: FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS.  Just because the phone is an IP 67 rated... DO NOT RISK IT!!! I REPEAT... DO NOT RISK IT!!!
there goes my 40k phone. üòë
Bought it online so... anyone knows the service centre is in NE India, please advise.",4

"The phone offers a lot for the price. Since you are here, you would already know the pros of the phone. The downside of the phone that you need to keep in mind while making the purchase is about the speaker.  The single firing speaker on the bottom is below par.  Also, though the phone is very slim I felt it is a bit heavy.",5

Ok,4
Excellent,5
"It was a decision after a lot of research from various sources and first-hand reviews from people already purchased the phone to go ahead with this phone - I won't ever regret this purchase!
I was a die-hard Sony fan but had to choose alternatives as it failed to keep up with current expectations and features except for the sound quality with its proprietary music player and camera quality.
But with the  Sony camera sensors + OLED screen + Snapdragon 845 + Oxygen OS = no regret
Phone providing all the expected performance and with regular software updates and android 9 running smoothly - no complaints !!",5

Dash charging is mind blowing..",5
Poor battery life when playing online games.,5
Very nice mobile but battery backup good but not great..,5
"You cannot ask for more from a phone at this price. Absolutely no lag at all and works like magic.
It would take some time to get adjusted with the size, if you had been on a 5 inch phone before, but afterwards you won't feel putting that down.
Tried few heavy games PUBG & Asphalt 9 and worked like a cake.
Love the parallel apps feature and the level of customization you can do.
highly recommended.",5

Poor quality camera worst video recording even 10k phone will give you better picture quality than this. Only thing I like is face unlock and dash charging. One plus 5 has better sound compared to this one . Good battery life till now. Before buying just compair mi 6 pro (13000) and this one (40000). MI is far better than this. I made Wong decision to buy this one.,1

Only thing that annoying me is the phone's inability to capture quality pictures in low light conditions.,5
Nothing,3
"Review after 2months usage. Pros- good picture quality, both cameras are excellent, sound is good. Good battery life.Cons - the apps like SBI , ICICI, food Panda taking too much time to open even after upgradation of OS. The second sim slot is not working properly. It will be active with full signal strength only but gives switched off response to other callers and for second slim slot some time OTPs will come very late. Something wrong with second sim slot. No headset will be given with purchase. Other than that very good mobile.",3

"It's very fast, & the charging is fastest I have ever seen.",5
Best product,5
Battery is very disappointed,1
It's a good buy.,5
The one phone you wish you had,5
"Based on my experience so far:
Pros
1. Speed - there's simply no match for it, you can open any number of apps simultaneously and it won't crash with 8 gigs of ram and Snapdragon 845 processor.
2. Display - looks good and the phone looks like a premium handset.
3. Price - got it at 35k (at a discount of 5k) when the last few pieces were available. Considering that 6T with minor upgrade for battery is priced at 42k (8 GB + 128 GB), this is value for money.
4. It's got a 3.5 mm jack - absent in 6T. Say what you want - 3.5 mm jack is currently a must for sound quality with good headphones and convenience (consider the inconvenience of carrying  a USB C adaptor etc.)
5. Good battery life - should easily get you thru the day even after heavy usage. Charging is also quick with the dash charge technology.
Cons:-
1. Sound quality on mono bottom firing speaker and earpiece is not on par with stereo speakers of my previous budget handset - Moto G4 plus.
2. No SD card - but this is compensated adequately if you have 128 gigs of internal storage
3. It's a glass back - need to handle delicately - can't imagine dropping it even with a back silicon cover.",4
5 star,5
"Jus wanna let you know that believe me... One plus 6T is kinda have same speed as 1+6.
The touch response of one+ phone is no doubt.. awsome... But 6T lags a bit .
REst enjoy .. gaming ... And watxhing movies and all in a large screen",5

Although, I still find the device bulky in my pocket.",5
Good product,5
"This is a very good phone. I used OP 3 and now bought OP 6. Everything about the phone is awesome. Only complaint i have is the speaker.

Otherwise there is no issue in the phone.",5

OnePlus 6 is an absolute beast when it comes to performance. The value for money tag of this device remains untagged as it gives a tough fight to the devices costing twice as much.,5
"It's the best you can find in not just its range but makes the big guys like Samsung and Apple run for money. The charging and the phone speed are the first things that have to be mentioned which are lightning fast. Next comes the oxygen OS which is a paradise for Android users. The display is not top notch but no complaints what so ever. The notch is dealt with perfection. The camera is where it requires improvement, you won't notice any issues in day to day pictures indeed they are amazing. When you push the camera a bit harder you will find minor drawbacks in comparison with the flagships. I am not sure what they did inside the phone but despite being a performance beast the battery doesn't let you down at all. Even if it the battery lets you down, the dash charger is there",5
Great and good phone,5

Quality is what you get when you go for the flagship phones. Oneplus 6 is just another example.,5
Awesome product,4
"Really liked the phone. It is everything it claims to be. High end hardware for a medium price range (when compared with iPhone). Battery is good, no heavy draining. 1 hour charging keeps my phone alive till next morning. Iam not a heavy gamer or always screen-on type of user. I use my phone in my breaks and mostly after reaching home. Hardware is still running good after incremental updates. I really really like the face unlock which even doesn't let you see the lock screen. Amazingly fast. Midnight black is really good with all the glass on its back it feels like a high premium quality mobile like around 80k. Best buy  in the price range and also a little above its price range.",5
"Writing Review After One Month....
One Plus Rocks...üòò
Sony User",5
"I bought this phone in July and its about to be 4 months now it is working perfectly. After upgrading to Android Pie, one glitch is there i.e. fingerprint sensor doesn't respond in once when phone is left untouched for a longer time. Rest all is good. Nightscape mode is also there in the latest update. Sound is good. Battery is also good but could have more like 6T. Earlier before Pie, optimisation was too high as most of the apps didn't run in background unless they are opened and kept open in Background (Outlook, Goibibo, MMT, etc) but now that is resolved. Satisfied with the phone overall. But if possible in next update remove that fingerprint issue also.",4
Awesome mobile,5
Sound could have Been better,5
Nice Mobile,5
"When I am using Facebook messenger it suddenly show app not responding. When I open camera, it closes automatically. Pro camera mode is not working good. I asked to OnePlus but the team told to clear cache. I did whatever team said, but facing same problem again and again.",4
Battery. Life improvement is required.. overall it is beast...üëåüëå,5
Nice,5
"1+6 simply good
Pic quality is good

One plus has outdone itself once again. The phone itself it too good. However the battery life just is for a day with data on. One plus 5 was battery used to be available with data on for day and half.,5

"Got it for 32k
Beautiful looks.decent battery.bit heavier than i expected.Decent sound.excellent camera. Gotta love the gestures.Ultrafast processor.feast to play pubg on this mobile. Handle with Care or this phone will break!Phone hanged once when I tried to turn on Bluetooth in reading mode but never faced that issue again. And nightscape mode is now available on op6 too via system update.no point in spending 8-10k for just smaller notch and a bit bigger battery.so I guess I don't regret buying op6 over op6t two weeks before release",5
Just awesome device,5
Don't think just buy this beast üî•,5
This phone is the best one I've ever used and in past I was an iPhone fanatic and now I'm completely shocked coz of how badly I felt cheated as the iPhones cost too much and don't give the performance and this phone is way better than any other iPhone in almost every way!! The 16+20MP camera can do miracle once you get used to it!! And the 8GB+128GB (RAM+ROM) combination is best for gaming .. you can push the phone to the maximum graphics limit and it'll still perform as smooth as butter!! And when it comes to looks I don't think any other phone has such nice design!!,5
Good camera and speed,5
"After the phone update:-
Phone is getting hanged every time.
Face unlock is not working properly.
And camera quality became poor.
Product is Good for nothing according to the Cost-wise.",1
Awesome,5
"Excellent, value for money",5
Please give specifications more on the phone. Ex it's not expandable.,5
Camera and sound quality could have been better,5
You don't need to see reviews when you're buying one plus :),4
"The price of this phone is great for all the awesomeness it packs in its glass body. First of all, it has a really really premium look and feel due to its glass sandwich design. Then comes the Oxygen OS which gives a very fluid and snappy experience of Android as it is very very close to stock Android with few minor tweaks for improvement. I am in love with this Oxygen OS.
Coming to the camera quality, it is really really great for its price point as it can easily stack up against phone which are double its price or more. Camera portrait and both normal modes are awesome. With a recent update it even got the same gesture functionality and nightmode like the OnePlus 6t.
To sum everything up, it is a great phone with great build quality and a premium look and feel with a great camera and an awesome 1080p screen. I can easily recommend it to you!üíØ",5

It's an amazing phone for under 40k. I got it at 35K under Diwali sale and it's the top end variant with 8gb ram & 256gb storage. It worth every single Rupee!! An excellent purchase for the price I got.,5
Loved it,5
I used last 20 days. I am very happy to decide to buy this phone. This is a long time wish to get a Oneplus phone. It is a battery full of one day full time use. UI experience is awesome. Thanks OnePlus team.,5
"I like everything about this phone. I feel the rear dual camera could be made more functional with more features. Battery life is OK for moderate usage. Heavy users might find that lacking. The best part is the rapid charging facility provided by Oneplus6. It's just AWESOME!!! The UI, picture quality is too good. Just love this gadget :)",5

True beast,5
I have been facing the problem of flickering light on the screen while using  the mobile and when the screen is turned off there is a light flickering on the edges of the phone .,5
"Phone has been upgraded to Android 9.0. Very aggressive battery and RAM management. Most aggressive I have experienced so far. And yet battery barely lasts for one day and average RAM usage is around 4GB on a regular basis. I don't play any games on mobile what so ever. No specific apps for social media like Facebook Twitter etc. Everything is handled on browser, that too very sparingly. Stand by battery consumption is poorer than my previous phone i.e Moto z play. This phone was blazing fast I must say but that too for only first few days. Now face unlock has slowed down considerably.
Not happy with RAM and battery management at all. I used to run activity tracking app on my Moto whole day without any problem. But oneplus just kills them in the background. Can't track activity on Apps like Pacer, Strava etc. I don't see what's the point of having 8 gigs of RAM if the phone needs to kill apps. And even then ironically avg RAM usage is 4gigs without any games, browser, social media apps, music or video running.
There is AMOLED screen but no always on feature. No extra ordinary screen resolution. Yet battery life is pretty much ordinary. One plus could have made the device a bit cheaper with LCD screen instead of AMOLED at least. For the premium of AMOLED over LCD I am only getting better contrast ratio and that too not par with the samsungs and apples.
Audio output of speaker is heavy on trebble side and lower frequencies appear to be muted gradually. 3.5 mm jack output is average with 16 ohms earphones. And with such battery performance never thought of connecting high impedance headphones.
On rear 20MP camera is pretty much useless for photos. It's just there for claiming that the phone has dual camera setup. Google has already shown that everything can be done with only one camera. And of course notch means there is no front flash.
Can't customize the slider button used to switch between silent vibrate and ring modes. That's pretty much fixed. I would have preferred I could turn on do not disturb with that button.
If not for assured software updates and little bit of water resistance, I would have opted poco f1. Built quality doesn't matter when you are going to keep the phone, which has glass on both front and back, inside a protective case.
The heat sink appers to be on the frame so phone gets really hot while performing tasks like navigation video calls etc if you keep it inside the case provided in the pack with phone.",3
Don't buy ... My back glass broken by falling from the bed and it was with case.. building quality is very low. Please avoid. i really hate this product,1
Overall phone is good.,5
Quality mattes for one plus brand,5
"Oxygen OS + Snapdragon 845 chipset is making this device more fluent. And the camera is just unbeatable at this price point. You'll get a security update on a quarterly basis. Someone says it ""Flagship killer"", well said.",5

"Am an early supporter of Oneplus since 2014 & always being satisfied with the phones though price has kept moving up.
This particular set was received at a very attractive price (considering oneplus One imported from US on invite) but did not load few Apps, server errors coming for some other just after opening and using it for the first time.
Amazon techinical team advised to load diagnostic app wich also failed to download. Dont know why this has happened.
Phone has been taken back by Amazon and had a worrid time with that!! Lost some opportunity on offers also due to return.",1

"Unhappy with my previous phone, I wanted a device which was gaming compatible, battery efficient, has a fast processor and offcourse enough space. After a lot of evaluation I purchased One Plus 6. Although, it was one of those instances when I was shelling premium but then I am extremely happy with my decision to purchase the product and the efficient delivery. Highly recommended.",5

Oneplus have finally made a phone which ticks most of the boxes since the opo,5

"In this price range, this is not a worthy product. As per my experience after 03 months only it has lot of problem.
1. It is stop showing notification of message on screen.
2. Incoming voice quality is also decreased always had noise problems while talking.
3. For early 01 month üîã life was good but now it is also decreasing.
4. Company is promoting high speed but I didn't find anything special from any 10k worth phone.
5. I purchase this phone for  camera quality but as such there is no specific features of camera.
I suggest instead of going this costly product better go for any low rates Samsung phone.",1

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!  I don't want bluetooth earpods that only last for 5 hours between charges and cost upwards of Rs.10,000 and have to be charged up at least twice a day!

Mobile is good and battery backup is not good. Price got reduced 7k/- within 10 days. Please Wait & purchase this kind of mobile.,3
The phone is giving out a wonderful performance. Very good in speed. Camera quality is superb. Dash charger is too god. Gets charged very rapidly. The only con I think is the battery capacity. OP could have increased the capacity.,4
Just go for it,4
Excellent,5
"Using it for the last 3 months, absolutely amazing phone,liquid smooth performance,awesome potrait images, actually it has a very decent camera, certainly a flagship worthy camera,display is nice and vibrant,sound quality is little bit under powered but overall a awesome package.....a buy recommended",5
All is good but the only problem is its dust ingress is too poor. They say its splash proof but when it is unable to restrict dust how can it restrict water???? Very easily dust enters within the camera glasses both rear and front cameras.,3
My phone ring tone is become in silent mode and it is not increaseing pl arrange for  rectification,5

Excellent phone in every aspect.,5

"The only thing I find not likeable about this product is that it is not IP68 water resistant.
If you don't care about that then it's really a no bainer. But I would suggest you to buy Oneplus 6T, since that is out in the market with around same pricing.",4
Great,5
"I have been using this phone from past one month now , what I liked about this phone is the battery life I usually get 5-6 hours of screen on time which is decent , phone looks premium , camera is also good and display is the best part . Things I didn't like is that it heats while playing high graphic games , sound quality from speaker is also a drawback and sometimes I feel sound from earpiece is also less .
Talking exclusively about battery , I use ambient display , I play pubg and use social apps frequently and get 5-6 hours of SOT . But if you'll use facial recognition battery will drain much faster .
Otherwise phone is awesome I will recommend it to everyone , best Android experience after pixel devices , I get all latest updates and I will prefer this over oneplus6t because of many reasons . Buy this undoubtedly the best Android smartphone as everything runs like knife on better with this phone .",5
"I bought the OnePlus 6 as an upgrade over my last smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy S3 Neo. Having used it extensively for over 3 months now, I guess I‚Äôm qualified enough to drop an informative review.
The delivery experience was smooth, without any hiccups. Amazon informed me of the date I‚Äôd get the phone after placing my order and true to their word, it arrived on time. The packaging was secure enough to prevent anything inside from getting tainted or damaged.
The OnePlus 6 comes in a lean but elegant package. You have the 6 stamped over the box and within you‚Äôll find the smartphone itself, a few service manuals neatly arranged, the Dash Charger and the USB-C cable. No OnePlus bullets earphones though. The phone itself comes with a scratch guard pre-applied and there‚Äôs a transparent rubbery case provided to apply on the back, just in case.
It takes a minute or two to setup and performs flawlessly. It‚Äôs been 3 months now and I‚Äôve yet to encounter a single application or task where I‚Äôve found the OnePlus 6 to ‚Äúlag‚Äù in any sense, a common occurrence with the Galaxy S3 Neo since its very early days. There have admittedly been times when games like Asphalt Legends unexpectedly crashed but those are few and far between, like once in two weeks. For the most part, I‚Äôm able to have extended gaming sessions with absolute ease.
OnePlus is known for its stock Android inspired Oxygen OS UI and it doesn‚Äôt disappoint. I bought the 64 GB model which gave me around 53 GB of free space to start. Performance is fluid, with little fluff or bloatware installed. OnePlus also has its own iOS inspired navigation gestures which are rather intuitive; you get used to them after fiddling around a bit. Initially configured with Android 8.1 Oreo, my unit was upgraded to Android 9 Pie in September and is due for another upgrade that should bring some of the OnePlus 6T‚Äôs exciting camera features.
Speaking of which, people have spoken a lot against the camera and I‚Äôll say this: you can get some brilliant pics if you use it the right way and circumstances, including environment setup, lighting and settings. Agreed night images are not excellent all the time but the 6T‚Äôs Nightscape mode should help change that. Video recording is crisp, even though I haven‚Äôt used it as often as I thought I would.
The AMOLED display looks sharp with strong colors. Don‚Äôt let the 1080p resolution deter you into thinking that it‚Äôs any less. In fact, not opting for Quad HD helps OnePlus last longer. I consistently average around 4-5 hours of screen time under moderate to heavy usage which increases to 7-8 hours if I‚Äôm doing nothing but watching videos. GPS consumes a lot of battery as usual.
There‚Äôs been a lot of talk about OnePlus smartphones being overpriced. For the premium build, lean OS and community experience that you‚Äôre getting, the price is honestly perfectly balanced. Personally, I don‚Äôt regret the fact that the 6T is out; I still much rather prefer my 6 as for me, it‚Äôs the model where OnePlus peaked with design and performance. An absolute recommend for anyone having any second thoughts about this. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.",5
I got this Amazing device at only 28 k rs.,5

"I upgraded to OnePlus 6 after using my first OnePlus device (OnePlus 2) for 3.5 years. So I know OnePlus devices are built to last.
I bought the OnePlus 6 during the great Indian shopping festival. I was initially waiting for the OnePlus 6T but after knowing the specs, decided to rather buy the OnePlus 6. I am completely satisfied and continue to feel that headphone jack is a great and useful thing.
Everything else is bang on except that the speakers could have been improvised in the OnePlus 6.",5
Best in class,5
It's a excellent product,5
Dash charger is great,5
"Phone is getting hanged many times and battery backup is very poor. Neither I play game nor I use phone much. Not sure why my phone battery is dying so soon. I may got the defective piece of oneplus 6.
Overall performance is OK like other smart phone. Nothing to feel great about Oneplus.",1
Osm,5
Awsome,5
"Face unlock doesn't work many times. This is no longer the budget phone it used to be. Now a days oneplus is spending heavily on marketing too. There are phones with better performance to cost ratio these days like poco etc. They are not innovative and late in most tech and hardware but they proclaim everything they give offer is break through. They were late in everything e.g. in display fingerprint, dual camera etc. They hype everything which most phones have it already so not longer quality and budget phone. They are just trying to create Fan base which is eventually back to other budget phones with better innovative,quality and price.",2

"Product received without no defects thanks for Amazon, got this product in amazing price for 37k while offer 256gb.

No complaints with the product. It is shocking though that I still havent received the promised cashback of Rs 2000,4
"Oneplus 6 performs smooth and has decent battery life. Charging speed is one of the fastest out there. Audio via head phone jack sounds really compressed and muddy i'm completely dissappointed with it's performance. Speaker sounds okay and gets reasonably loud. The camera takes some decent pictures but the images look overly processed and has aggressive noise reduction which reduces the detail and sharpness of the pictures. Video recording is good with good stabilisation and the 480 fps slow motion video mode is fun to use but it needs a bit of work as it drops quite a lot of frames and makes the video look jittery even with ample lighting. The display is really good with excellent colours and offers good saturation levels and makes the colours pop. The software is very minimalistic, snappy, fluid and easy to use. The call quality,signal reception and wifi performance are also very good. But now with phones like lg g7 thinq being available at a lower price than the oneplus 6 and oneplus 6t and oneplus ditching the headphone jack for the 6t make it hard to recommend these phones as that lg phone has ip rating, better qhd display, wireless charging and quad dac for better audio performance and a wide angle camera which is rather useful than the useless 20 mp camera of the oneplus 6 and 6t. Overall oneplus 6 is a good phone but not the best in its price range as it used to be from the oneplus 3 to the oneplus 5t. Even the oneplus 6t is also being priced close to 40000 which makes oneplus lose the customers who made the company. Even they are gradually increasing the prices and the features doesn't justify the price increase.",3

"I was a Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 user for 3 years before I switched to OnePlus 6. This is the most expensive phone I ever got and it was totally worth the amount I paid (INR 27999).
Following would be my ratings -
1. Bloatware - 5/5 (none)
2. Performance - 5/5
3. Camera - 4.5/5  ( Use Samsung Note9 to know what 5/5 means)
4. Audio Quality - 3/5 (only bummer. Speaker is as mediocre as Redmi phones) -  Considering I don't watch netflix on phone, its totally ok for me.
5. Build - 4.5/5
6. Battery - 5/5 (with super fast dash charging)",5
This is the best premium phone you can get for this price. The snapdragon qualcom processor is amazing. The camera is good. The best part is this phone charges very rapidly courtesy of the dash charger and the battery life is long.,5

I Loved it #best flagship killer",5
Outstanding phone and also its UI but sounds are average,5
"Overall this is one of best phone which I used ,  great photo and video quality, above average low light photo quality, bright display , long battery life and the most important things is very good performance (never seen any slowness issue)
Now the second part, I am not sure it is only bug in my phone but I am facing a pathetic call voice issue It drops voice call and sometimes difficult to understand what others are saying I intially thought it is network issue but when I compared to my other phone ( Sony Xperia XZ Premium) it was very clear in same. I contacted Amazon but as return window is closed I need to run behind service centers Very disappointed as need to repair my brand new phone now Amazon should change retun policy at least for expansive phone. In future better i will avoid these Chinese brand , Sony and other similar reputed brands are always better in quality as they do thorough testing at least basic features.",2

"According to me it's not worth to spent this much amount behind One Plus brand. I am facing issue of phone hang specially in contact app. As suggested by Service station engineer done the update. Even after factory reset, still problem is unresolved.",1
"Camera quality is NOT good at all. By seeing unboxing vidoes and reading reviews I had a impression that camera should be good, but since I am using and realised camera is not at all good. Pics don't have clarity. Night photos sucks, it's better not to take photos at all during night times because it is an embracing movement while showing to others üò£
Slow video is the worst feature because no clarity at all.
Sound is not amazing but ok ok. Because one need to keep increasing and decreasing volume to hear properly.
If Bluetooth earpods are connected then battery dies very fast compared to other phones like Samsung and Moto.
Good thing is RED back looks very premium and beautiful.",4

So, my experience was fantastic and I know it's for short duration but I completely loved it. From looks to performance this product is amazing.
Hope to buy it again when I will have the sufficient funds for it.
Till then go for it you will love it like I did once.",5

"One plus phone : 5+ star
Amazon customer service : Null Pointer Exception
I bought One Plus 6 on 9th October and got it delivered on 11th October. I tried to register for Free Damage Protection (servify / 811 kotak bank).
But I couldn't register as kotak bank was not providing offer and it was still showing on Amazon website.I dropped mail to Amazon, one plus and kotak bank and also discussed this matter with their customer service agents.
Most amazing reply was from Amazon . Amazon representative told that although they are promoting false promise but as the offer is provided by kotak bank , amazon will not take any responsibility.
Again amazon providing same offer for one plus 6t and they changed registration process this time.
I want to ask amazon if they are following good practice as they are not providing the services that they have promoted during their biggest festival sale.",1
"Awesome,One plus",5
"Phone is very good. I love everything about it. Camera is awesome. Screen is superb.
Cons:
1) we can't use hotspot while receiving or making a call, which is a big downside.
2) I see severe battery heating issues, when I play games online. Once playing game, I got a call, and after few minutes, phone became so hot that I had to cut the call and turn off wifi.
3) some times while using a app it automatically gets close. Which very starnge.
4) I wanted to exchange it, after using for 3 days, as I started seeing issues, but Amazon did not have options to exchange. Only to refund.",4

Best beast,5
"Took away one star because Amazon delivered it in a filthy plastic cover with some bubble wrap. Not even a box for a high price item.
Product Review:
1. Camera is very good...but not the best in low light (not expecting better low light photos from a phone)
2. Call reception is good. Loud and clear sound wen playing music. But no stereo effect. I love that part in my iPhone 7.
3. Display is excellent.
4. Battery life is excellent. The best part is it‚Äôs dash charger. Charges to 100% in about an hour.
5. Glass back is beautiful but one has to be really careful in handling it. Better use a cover. I use the one which came along with it free. (Takes always the charm though)
 6. Speed is awesome. Fingerprint scanner and face unlocking is fast & superb",4

Good phone with all best features.,5
Excellent performance,5
"1) Amoled display of this mobile was so good,
2) The single down side speaker of this mobile was not good because while playing games or movies in landscape the finger accidentally muffling the sound,
3) The Battery life of the mobile was good and adequate for single full day usage and the Dash charge aka fast charge juices the battery with in 1hr15mins.
4) The Gaming and day today app usage are too snappy and particularly gesture type was smooth,",5

this handset is technically faulty . incoming call voice is breaking ..its not sound proper.. breaking voice comes.,1
Actually this is the best mobile ever I used perfect for everyone,5
"Good battery life, awesome camera, very good speed with no lagging issue",5
They advertise it as a metal body and gorrilla glass. But display/Glass quality is very poor. It gets broken even if it drops from 2 ft distance. Not recommended.,2
"A few days back OnePlus 6 8gb ram 256gb was for 38,999 and 8gb 128gb was for 34,999
Now the same
 ""One plus 6 8gb 128gb used-acceptable"" is for  35,000.

"I have always wanted to own a flagship phone, and OnePlus 6 is my very first flagship. The reason not to wait for the 6T is because i already had quite a few expensive headphones and i don't want to buy a USB C to 3.5mm dongle nor the new bullets headphones.  Overall I am very satisfied with the phone.",5
Cool,5
"Worst customer care service ever, took them a week to tell me that a replacement isn't possible when their own affiliated employees couldn't do their own job.

All above mentioned features qualities are really excellent. I am satisfied with the product.,5

Battery also should be strong and more powerful for good performance so we can use long time time.
IF Enable the GPS then battery life only maximum 4 hrs.",5

Sound....and network frequency better than any mobile...my rating is 10/10,5
Best phone,5
"After a week of using the One Plus 6, I find this phone amazing to use. I won‚Äôt go for a spec listing. You can get it from websites.
I preferred to buy this even after knowing 6T was being launched was because 6T has very little upgrades and costs 10k more.
Note to people using high end Samsung phones - You would really hate the display ,compared to Note 8/9 or s8/s9 ,this display is a joke. but overall this phone has great value for money
Originally, I have a One plus 3T. As an upgrade, I went for the Honor 10 on Flipkart. Flipkart, however, made a mess with the delivery. Please read my Flipkart review recently for details. I had to cancel the phone. The next choice after using the One plus 3T was obviously OP6.
One Plus 6 Features
The pleasant surprise for me was definitely the large 19: 9 aspect ratio FHD screen. It‚Äôs a 6.28 inches display but still easy to hold and use with one hand mostly. Being a AMOLED display, the colors are very vibrant even in sunlight. I love using it for social media ( Instagram, FB, WhatsApp) since its longer screen can fit in a number of feeds. I also enjoy reading with it. Videos in full view even with the notch are amazing to watch.
The coolest feature in the display is doing away with the physical keys or the software keys. You can use gestures to do these functions and take advantage of a larger full screen.Swiping from bottom to the middle takes you home. Swiping from left or right bottom to the middle takes you back. Swiping from the bottom to the middle and holding gives you recent apps. The problem I face is when using the keyboard very fast while typing. It just goes home sometimes which can be irritating. It‚Äôs just getting confused between the typing and the gesture to go home I think. I use the swiftkey keyboard dragging to avoid it but OP must improve this gesture.
The os is very fast thanks to it being very bloatware free and using the Snapdragon 845. There is no lag whatsoever and it is a pleasure using this phone.
Fast charging is awesome on this phone. You are all set even if you charge for half an hour to get to 60% approximately. Very handy in today‚Äôs fast-paced life.
Rear cameras @16 mp and 20 mp are quite handy to use featuring portrait and bokeh modes. The front camera also offers decent output @ 16 mp. I loved the addition of slow-motion capture on the primary camera which works well. However, you need bright lighting for it to work well.
Fingerprint and face recognition features are super fast to use. Its small thoughtful things like the option of the screen lighting up in the dark to recognize your face and unlock is what makes this device a compelling one. Speaker is mono and functional to use. Its audio via headphones is amazing, however.
Another welcome addition is true dual VOLTE support. You can have two Jio Sims running in parallel here. This means people calling your Jio number when you‚Äôre an idea or Vodafone data connection is active will be able to connect with you. Both Sims can remain on 4g.
For the cash you pay, I think this phone is amazing to own and use every day.",4
Awesome,5
"Great phone everything besides:
Less battery for high performance
Gets heated after long time use
Display is active below notch",5
Low light photo quality is not good. Too much noise in pics.,4
"mediocre battery performance
mediocre audio output from the speaker
no fm radio",5
"Best picture quality and sound quality with the android pie update it works like charm, OnePlus comes up with the best everytime but the only concern was the battery life it should have been bit better but dash charging makes up for it.",5
Best product... Awesome touch....,5
Performance is solid and looking also awesome.,5
Perfect,5
Good performance,4
"I bought one plus 6 in august and paint is coming out form side panel after 1 month.
One plus refuse to serve me regarding this.",2
"Great Product, Great Price",5
"Screen quality is pretty amazing. Performance wise there are no lags observed even with multiple apps open in background.
Sound quality is average.
Camera quality is just superb. Portrait mode works pretty well with the edges in decent lighting conditions but I observed some smoothening happening in a bit low light conditions.
Selfies are also pretty amazing.
4k videos provide the real feel of the moments and 720p with 480fps capability is really good.
Battery life can support for just over one day with normal usage. Thanks to dash charging for charging from 10% to full in 45-50 mins.",5
"Great camera, but 750fps slow motion is not good the quality is slightly blurred at that time but the whole phone is too much good",5

"I'm a huge fan of Oneplus. My first smartphone is OP 1 which lasted for 3 complete years. Then I purchased OP6.
No doubt about it's quality, speed and performance.
The dash charger provided is super fast.
The most stand out point about Oneplus is it's software updates.
The premium quality body is among the best available in the market.
Although the phone doesn't have features like waterproof and dust-proof, but no issues considering it's overall price in comparison with some of the high end, same configuration phones in the market.
The only small drawback is it's speaker volume which is lesser in comparison to OP1 but still is way better than other phones.
Overall, best phone available in the market.",5
Awesome phone,5
Excellent,5
"Picture quality is Beautiful,
Sound is very good.",5

"Picture quality is fine, sounds good and battery life is good too...",5
Got this phone for my mom for her birthday during the sale and I was surprised at how brilliant it was for its price. Seriously the best phone on the market for 30k,5
Really nice and sturdy phone.Got a good deal and Amazon shipped it on time.Charging is not as fast as it claims but still fast enough.Picture quality is good and battery backup is good as well.Oneplus has lived up to its expectations,5
Too much costly but but breaks it without knowing even u care too much,1
Is good and very smart.,5
Battery backup is little low,5
"The picture quality and display is not even up to the One plus standards. I am feeling like I got the defective product or reused one, on big billion.
Selling a product on discount should not affect it's brand value. Please exchange with the new product.",2
Good phone,5

"Iam a user belonging to Computer science background, previously i have used many phones , rooted them and tried to alter and tweak settingo get the most out of them in terms of performance, screen on time etc
Its been 17 days i have been using this device as my daily driver and believe me earlier i used to root my new phones the 2nd day inorder to put custom roms to get the most out of them, but in case of OP6 the oxygen OS works flawlesly and i have not felt any need for rooting.
Pros:
-No lag in application opening, switching, opening and multitasking at all.
-fingerprint scanner is damn fast.
-Supports rapid charging till 100% battery after pie update. (30min = full charge approx)
-1080 60p and 4k 60 fps with OIS is a treat for eye to watch.
-clicks good low light photos (although u can see some grains visible if its too low lighting).
-clicks stunning normal artificial and day light photos.
-Handles all heavy games flawlesly no lag.
-gaming mode 3.0 is a definite plus.
-no over heating issue (phone will heat a bit during gaming but not too much at a level where user can get uncomfortable.)
-i play pubg at smooth graphics , extreme fps with colourful option selected doesnt lags at all even while rushing on a full squad.
-Or rushing while aircraft goes by since user face lag due to aircraft sound.
-10 min charge = 2 full pubg game kudos to that :D
-microphone and speaker quality are excellent
Cons:
- Unavailibility of original oneplus accesories in amazon and in oneplus.in aswell, been trying to get the 3D screen guard but its still out of stock
-if u play heavy games like pubg at 5% battery it will lag severly, coz OS lowers processor frequency at 5% battery level the only lag issue i faced ^_^.
-I fing the slider on the right a bit stiff it requires a little more pressure to move up or down (although experience may vary depending upon user).
-The major drawback i have found is the unavailibility of immediately lock application after leaving option in the default app lock application that comes with the oxygen OS.
-because of this i had to install third party app locks which sometimes doesnt respond to fingerprint scanner.
-fingerprint magnet since i own mirror black but i like to wipe it and keep my phone shiny so it doesnt affect me that much :D",5
No scratchless display.,1
Best phone for the price,5
Awsum fone,5
The best phone ever for me.. only the battery runs up fast..,5
"Changing review stars to 2.
If you zoom any picture, the picture clarity is worst than 10k mobiles. Very disappointment from OnePlus. Only u hv to watch the pics without zoom. Guys think before you opt for OnePlus as I promise that in 30k range u get superb camera mobiles. Sometimes overall phone hangs and camera also hangs. Overall camera clarity is like less than 10k mobile.
Pros : Mobile build quality, display, Network Signal, Finger Print, face unlock, Fastness are excellent. Charging is ultra fast and the best among the flagship mobiles which i used.  No heating issue. Ultimate front and back appearance.
Camera quality is superb but expected the best from oneplus.
Cons : They would have provided ear phones and some interesting unique features and nothing unique to explore in this phone. Bit heavy but manageable. Creating hype by producing/keeping less stock for 64GB variant which is not good. Holding comfort is average as the width is bit more.",2
It's very nice phone,5
What i tell is less for this phone. Use first then u will be a fan.,5

"Likes
1. Snapdragon 845 - Fastest CPU and Best GPU in android world
2. Amoled Display is stunning and great
3. Built quality is premium but you need a cover to protect it
4. 8 GB LPDD4X RAM
5. REAR CAMERAS ARE GOOD
6. Love DASH Charging it's fast and save time
7. Oxygen OS - Best android version , its like pure  android with some meaningful features no bloatware
8. Fast update , using Android 9 pie from last 1 month through (beta version)
9. Face unlock is very good
Dislike
1. Battery life is average must come with 4000 mAh battery
2. hate notch
3. more pure android approach
4. DASH Charging is now becoming old must implement OPPO Flash VOOC charge
5 Face unlock must be through hardware like apple and poco which are more reliable
Overall best phone",5

Battery easily lasts for one to one and half day with full usage. Phone gets completely charged in 1 hour 15 mins to 1 hour 30 minutes. I feels it lasts longer if we charge for a bit longer when it reaches 100%. Photo quality is great. Fingerprint sensor is great too. Face unlock is also very efficient and fast.",5

Awesome I love this phone,5
"Very good features, ultimate camera quality",5
"Been a one plus consumer since it's launch. No complains. The pocket mode is sometimes irritating. Otherwise no complains. I did not wait for 6T as there is not huge difference. The setup itself says the good old numeric lock may be superior than finger print scanner. So don't worry a lot on these small features and pay a bomb for them. Fast, reliable and durable.",5
Amazing product,5
"Amazingbproduct by oneplus, expecting more from oneplus in next generation. Hoping good",5
Outstanding product. I have purchased the mobile worth Rs 27999 and Rs 1000 received as Amazon pay.,5

Picture quality is good provided you know how to adjust the settings etc.... Sound is loud but without much feel.... Overall battery life is quite good as I don't play games.... UI is really smooth not like other android phones.... Recommended for having OP6,5
except the size the phone is wonderful,5
"awsm phone camera is suprb but battery back up is average.....
i still did not get any email about screen replacement offer.....",5
I love it,5
"I'll tell you why OP6 is better than OP6 T overall and where OP6 T score more points. Below are features of OP6T compared to OP6.
1. OP6T has bigger battery. Around3.7k mah. The only good thing about T.
2. Little bigger screen. Same hardware though, with update on GGlass 6. OP6 has GG5
3. On screen finger print. Prob is it is a bit slow. Takes more than 4s on avg. OP claims 3.4s. And you need to light up screen before using fingerprint to power up the sensor on screen. So technically you have to click power button and long-touch the screen.
4. Point number 3 leads no space for headphone jack (idk why OP can't give a headphone jack on top)
5. 1, 3 lead to increase in phone thickness. It is not as slim as OP6
6. Camera is completely same as in OP6, both hardware and software with additional night mode. I anyway use Pixel 2, 3 camera app software downloaded from xdm.
7. Base variant is same cost as base variant of OP6, but will have 128GB storage instead of 64GB. Good thing if OP6 sells without discount. But not happening.
8. Notch size decreased. Known thing. Drop üíß notch. Not at all a pro. Not a con too.",5
The phone is perfect.,5
Amazing,4
Super phone,5
the phone is perfect in every aspect and hope to see more phones like these but there is a little heating problem,5
Awesome,5
My opinion is if you have budget then definitely buy this phone.,5
"1.Very poor camera quality,
2. Hanging problem",2
A good product,5
I bought oneplus 6 just18 days before and from the begining itself am facing heating issue on my phone the phone and the charger is heating while charging and also while talking photos or videos .... so i raised complaint for that and they told we will send technician to my home but still no one has came.,1
Excellent product. Happy with it,5
"Its an awesome product. I have been using it for 2 months now and loving it.
Pros- Camera , Display , Storage , face recognition tool , lightweight , very good looking handset and 8 GB RAM .
Cons- Battery Backup and Speaker Quality- They are good but there is bit of a room for improvement.
Overall, its more than worth the price.",5
Very good device,5
"Sound quality is not good in earphone and loud speaker. Battery life is little bit disappointed me , it's needs to improve in it . furthermore, its picture quality it's not good as they hip potrate shot is not properly taking,it's very bad in low light,
Battery life is not good I am not havy user I'm not playing games, not much use social site,not much playing music ,I'm a simple user,after that I needs to charge twice a day",4
really great phone. everything about that phone is niceee,5
Sound quality is not great this time when on loudspeakers.,4
"Worst product and embarrassing customer Care of Amazon.... ""exchange policy of Amazon"" is really a horrible... very bad experience...once they have sold the product they're liable for Post sale service. Amazon sold me defective oneplus 6, 8gb ram, 256 gb,  under exchange offer. There technician visited and certified that the mobile is defective. After 2 days exercise they approved the replacement. But there was no update from Amazon about the replacement of mobile. After several Chat sessions, call from team (Everytime cutomar Care person Will ask"" What's the issue sir"", this is embarrassing)...now Amazon changed the color. Now they're unable to replace the mobile and insisting refund. And refund of exchange value of old handset only in Amazon account so customer can't use that money other than Amazon.....really a horrible purchase... Actually I appreciate Amazon but this first experience is totally disturbing for me....still matter is pending and let's see.... end of the episode. You",1
There is not a single reason to hate it..... Value for money,5
All over the device is good and can beat and other brands in performance level.,5
Amazing phone with all loaded features are best of the best phone seen ever in my life. Love this phone,5
"Positive:
Awesome phone...worth buying for picture and sound quality. Great experience as of now.
Purchased on 15th Oct'18
Negative:
Kindle app not working. If Amazon can share the purpose of including Kindle app?
Battery life could have been slightly better..",5
Speakers are not so loud need to keep the full volume to hear it clear. Battery is wrost. It drains even without any usage. Really regretted after buying it.,1
"Superfast...super phone..only thing average is front camera..if you compare it with vivo v11, as it packed with 25 no camera..Rest..I'm loving it..!!",5
"Nice product

The camera and display quality could have been made better for ur quoted price of 39999. But because I bought this for 33000 it's a bit fine for me.

"This phone is really a masterpiece when it comes to speed and display quality. The screen is superb with excellent details. Sound quality is exactly what we like and what we want. The slider to change the mode to vibrate and silent is cool. Although the battery is good enough, but a heavy user might get a little disappointed with battery. My expectations with camera quality was also not met. The photo quality is good but when we zoom in, it does get blurry which I believe should not happen.",5
Superb phone better than iPhone,5
"My review is based on my thoughts and my experience which I never found on the internet while searching about this smartphone.
I would speak about an experience of people like me for whom this smartphone is the first flagship killer they ever bought.
1. This phone is damn fast and we all know that. So we never get to experience anything like a lag. A whole new experience for anyone for the ones who are planning to change their phone from budget to a mid-range flagship.
2. One shouldn't define it as flagship. It's not a flagship. It's a flagship killer which means you will have a flagship like experience on a smartphone which looks or feels like a budget smartphone when held in hand. It doesn't feel like using a true flagship device. note: If you have 10k extra go for the LG G7+ ThinQ. It is a complete package and a true flagship...!! Also, Pixel 2 XL is available at 40k during festival offers so you can have a look at it too.
3. My major questions when I was confused in between buying Oneplus 6 or LG G7+ ThinQ was
(i) which camera was better! Oneplus 6 or Lg G7+ ThinQ...?? The answer is LG G7 is better except for Oneplus has an edge over better video taking technology and better selfies.
(ii) Which screen feels better for the eye...?? The screen quality on LG G7+ ThinQ feels a lot better than Oneplus 6 despite G7 being an IPS display and Oneplus 6 an Optic AMOLED.
4. The audio quality is the biggest silent drawback of Oneplus 6. In other words, I never enjoyed while playing a song through my headphones.
Overall, I would definitely suggest buying a Oneplus smartphone to anyone for its amazing software, its speed, and performance for the given price.",4
Good product,5

This is one of the best smartphones I've ever used. It has got a very good battery life and it charges crazy fast. The sound quality and overall performance is very good. it's a complete overall package with the best counterparts in it. I got it for a crazy price of rs20981. The camera quality is of flagship level and takes very good low light pictures.,5
Battery life,5
The sound system in the device has stopped working and now I am getting the run around to get it replaced!!,1
Wonderful phone,5
Awesome,5
"It's really awesome.... Picture quality, camera, graphics, internal view & external view, battery life, sound quality, features, specifications is really mind blowing...",5
"In my opinion, the white variant is the only one which isn't a fingerprint magnet. Also, it has a beautiful pearl like sheen to it. But it is very soft and could easily slip out of your hand. I won't describe the specs as everyone is thorough with it. I consider it the year's most optimised mobile. And dash charging has to be mentioned... it is inspiring. The phone doesn't heat up. I have played games, watched videos and browsed the web almost continuously. Yet I haven't felt any significant heating issues. The primary camera is wonderfully tuned. And the display is beautiful. The only drawback I have found is that it lacks stereo and dual audio speakers. Just a single, bottom facing speaker. For the amount we pay, that feature should have been provided. But otherwise, this is the best phone yet. However, if the One Plus 6T turns out to be better and sells for the same rate, it would be a blow to the present ""6"" owners.",5
"I have purchased one plus 6 (8gb) variant on 12th Oct. Awesome phone in terms of picture quality, camera, performance. Sound quality ia good not that much loud. Battery can last loner 1 day but it has dash charger so it can charge 75% phone in 35 min. So that can solve this problem. no lagging at all. I have played asphalt 9, punha like game. It has really good processor and ram management is good.",5
Great phone. No hang. Vgood camera. Very fast.,5

"All criterions are top notch on the device..the only thing to address is the camera.. although it is simply the best in it's range..I advice everyone to install the Gcam mod from XDA...the camera hardware is extremely capable and with the pixel camera..well it becomes a pixel 2xl with a snapdragon 845..also camera 2api is natively supported so download n u are ready to go.
 The pic I have attached was taken in complete darkness and only the flash was used.. shutter speed was 1/4th of a second (OIS) helps hugely here.",5

The slide bars and curves in the ui were hot.
By bad luck, I lost my phone within a month of order... I miss it so much",5
Only one problem is screen glass any tempered glass won't fit exactly other than tht phone is awesome,5
I just loved the camera... U just need to smile and the camera clicks the pic by its own...,5

"Hi RocketKommerce,
I bought this product on 29th of August and I have been using this for the last 2 months. I am facing too many problems with this system as its getting hang sometimes when incoming calls, and I am unable to answer to the calls. Also, It's getting stagnant while I connect my headphones.
When it comes to its camera, I have some major problems while recording the video in a good room light conditions (the pixels of the video is getting confined). Slow motion video out is getting flickering in close shots and several others problems. I am sort of tired using this over-hyped mobile device and I really want to return this phone to Amazon and apply for the refund as I believe Amazon and Rocket Kommerce show their credibility to respond to this and act wisely.
Thanks and looking forward to your reply.",2
No one can beat this beast,5

Overall Satisfy our need.",5
Great product!!!,4
"A superb phone. Been a one plus user for close to 2 years now. A big jump up from the 3T.
Just one point of caution. Since it's a glass phone, you may want to get a case with chunky borders. But as it's already a slightly larger phone, you might want to be cautious in case you have hands that are on the smaller side.
On the battery, entirely on usage. It should last you about 5 hrs 30 on screen time and if you got a schedule that keeps you off your phone, a day is easily done.
On the whole, am really happy with the purchase.
The surprise element for me is the camera. Significant move up for me personally from the 3T.",5
Never hesitate to buy oneplus 6 it never disappoints you with his performance i just suggest you all just don't think much just go for it...bcz its a next generation smartphone,4

Facing some issues with it whom to contact with,1
"Amazon delivery was outright bad for this. I had got an exchange deal with this, little did I know the delivery experience would be so horrible
The package was supposed to be delivered on 11th day after ordering. The delivery executive asked me if i have reset my original device. I said I am using the device and will reset once he checks it's imie and will barely take a minute. He hung up on me saying we don't have so much time and you should reset earlier. He moved shipment to be delivered next day
I called him only to hear the rude reply again
Then, Amazon didn't deliver next day
The next to next day, a good courier guy finally ordered it
The phone is awesome and the color is touche
Speed, battery life are amazing and phone charges like in a blink
The bezels are thin. Oneplus launcher is really nice. I can see oneplus has left no stone unturned
Speaker phone is a charm to use
WiFi is better than most phone I have used
Only con is, you have a single speaker so can muffled volume while watching a youtube video
That's it
Awesome device
Buy it",5
Not so good battery life.,5
"All are good,but battery backup is low.",4

After using 4 months  I surely tell that OnePlus is the best among all I have iPhone 8 plus n my bro have OnePlus 6 when I'm using the max con I notice when compared to iPhone n OnePlus the main part is about charging the beast we both use mobile at a time max up to 5 hours with full charge when ever the battery is low we put charge at same time with 20 min my bro uses his phone while my takes up to 2 hours of charge !,5
Thanks Amazon for d get offer...phn came in my budget. Battery could be better ...,5
"I feel the product I light weight, Rear camera quality is too good. Front camera is also gud but not to the standard. Sound quality is gud. Battery life stable for one day..",4
"Battery life seems to be average. No boost charge. Picture quality and camera are superb, you'll fall in love with the phone just for the photos it can take. The back has a pearly feel, and I'd love to use it bare, but due to fear of fall, am using a transparent case which came with the product. No earphones, but that's alright. Overall, a much much better value for money than the gold digging iphone and google pixel numbers.",5
Nice fpne,5
"Best compared to iPhone and Samsung
Low price and better performance",5
"all good but battery back to less.,",5
slow motion videos especially 720p @480 fps during low light conditions are pathetic...except that everything seems perfect...no lags so far and no other issues as well....Buy it...in just  few more bucks it is way better than poco or any other competitors...,5
Best flagship phne in budget range. I seriously love this phone.  And its camera is wonderful. everything about this phne is so very perfect.,5

Coming to dash charging, it is really a very good option to choose dash charging support...it can charge up to 60% with in 25 -30 min and battery backup also nice, if you are a medium user it lasts a whole day..
Picture quality is also really veey nice...
Sound qulaity is awesome...perfect loudness and perfect clarity",5

ok,5
I ordered this phone on October 12th n it's been two weeks am using this. Highly disappointed with battery life as its drains very quick even after the battery saver n recommended settings advised. It's not worth paying for high price. For one instance morning @ 10 I charged OP6 full and at by 1 o'clock by noon the battery has come down to 75% without any much usage. Please help me out on this,2

All are good except battery life.i have been issue with my battery life my phone battery is drain out so fast like charging dash charging only two week now i started use this phone and also some problem with the speaker while ringing.im expecting solution from the authorities,2
Happy,5
I have talk and complain two three times for product replacement your person also visited and confirm to replace product but there is no further information.,1
"Only one word , outstanding",5
Battery life is below average.,4
Very good product,5
"Let me clarify, the product meets all its criteria and rather excellently. But, this certainly not a flagship killer.
The good:
1. Phone feel sturdy, light and handy. Comes with Oneplus branded back case and already fixed screen protector
2. 128GB is literally unlimited, wont miss absence of memory card
3. Very smooth and user friendly software, you will feel at home irrespective of whichever other skin you were used to
4. Camera is good, but low light quality leaves a lot to desire
5. Battery backup is comparable to other flagships, easily last through the day. Dash charger is also pretty first, again comparable to other flagship
6. Screen quality is decent, but a notch lower to Samsung sAMOLED. Sound from the single speaker is adequate. Sound is loud, but you surely mark the missing depth from a LG or HTC.
7. Regular updates are a treat
Not so good:
1. A flagship killer that saves money by skipping headphones. Samsung comes with AKG co-branded one while LG gets Tone.
2. Packaging is too ordinary, while Samsung S series or LG G series makes you feel special. Comes with a pin ejector and charger, nothing else. Skims on manuals and user guides too.
3. Water proofing is their word vs the world. Do dare test it without an IPS certification.
4. Though good quality case and screen protector provided, but somehow feels short of the likes of Amzer etc. I would have preferred an standard headphone instead of case.
5. Data transfer software does not consider memory cards of old phone. Lack of memory card support and an usb adapter (Samsung gives them) means, its an herculean task to transfer your data.
To summarize, Oneplus6 wont disappoint you, but at the same time wont excite you either. At the similar  price point, Samsung S8 or LG G7 comes with much bling factors to keep you engaged for sometime. Regarding 8 GB RAM, unless you run bench-marking software everyday, you wont notice a difference.",4
I am using a faulty OP6 now. Can't able to call support as return window is closed. No body called me back even when said by support team many times. Disappointed.,1
Everythng z prfct...,5
So for it is good,5
"I expected more night life photos..But this worst and pixels shown..Really worried..
About sound and battery it's fine.",4
"I have purchased One plus 6 on 10th October 2018. It has audio problems. When I talk on phone certain times I can't hear and certain time the opposite person can't hear. I have been observing this since 2 weeks, initially I thought it was a network issue.",3
Did not get any invoice with the package.,2
Awesome,5
Best phone,5
"Anytime stop responding then have to wait for 10 min for auto response. Voice getting raise anytime in between while playing music or video.
Amazon customer care also helpless to do anything on it. Raised 1 complaint with them to replace it due to some 3rd party app is not working on this device.",1

The best phone in this price segment,5
Super Phone...battery is not too great but dash charging solve the problem. Overall best deal. Acko screen protection plan needs several reminders to Amazon team and then they forward it.,5
"This is my second Oneplus device after having used Oneplus 3 since the launch of the so called Flagship back then. Completely impressed with the dash charging back then in 2015, the only disadvantage i have ever felt in OP3 is battery life as it drains fast. That too is completely sorted in OP6 as i am getting more than a day in average usage and close to a full day with live streaming on mobile data and continous screen on time. Camera is a vast improvement which will definitely compete with the best. Guys just think about the price point here and you can easily forget any minor flaws. The only one which i think fares better than OP6 is Note 9. But again it cost 70k. Finally i got the red color which i longed for. Completely satisfied with the purchase. Giving 4 stars to the battery as i still wanted 3800 or 4000 mAH.",5

Best product,5
Like.. everything,5
"Pros:
Best phone with SD 845
Value for money
OSM clicks
Cons:
Sound quality can be better",5
No doubt... It's beast... Awesome experience... So far... Superfast app loading..... It's actually fit the tagline.... The speed you need.... I m quite impressed... More dan wat i expected.... Most importantly 4 hrs of continuous pubg(HD mode and high frame rate) i played... It's quite impressing... And top up time... Dere is nothing to say about dis... Well made decision... To upgrade from oneplus 3T,5
As usual awesome nothing more to say,5
Excellent in all. Best pick,5
"Best delivery by Amazon.
Delivery boy open and show product to me that there is original product they give me.
Now we can trust Amazon more now.
Oneplus 6 is just amazing phone.
Dont think just book it.
Amazing photo quality...sound
I have mirror black colour
Phone look great",5
"Camra Parfamus is not good.
Sound and battery life is very good.",5
Worth buying this phone. It's gives an iPhone or Samsung tough competition. Battery needs improvement but dash charge makes up for it.,4
"I'm a pro smartphone user. I judge every aspect for the review.
Pros-
1. Dash charge is amazing. 1hr 10 mints hardly and full charge. Battery 1 day on normal usage.
2. Beautiful display. AmoLed really is superb.
3. Daylight or artificial light, you won't complain the camera.
4. Beautiful design, no doubt premium.
5. OxygenOS is like liquid.
6. Snapdragon 845 really boosts your internet speed.
7. Never lags in any game.
8. Ah those gestures. I love that.
9. Who complained about speaker, I don't feel it is low. It is good infact.
10. That notch! Pause.
Cons-
1. Very fragile. You have to keep it very carefully. Has tendency to slip.
2. Don't rely on Gorilla glass 5, it breaks. I've seen it. Probably the back glass will break first.
3. OxygenOS is great. I don't understand why it hangs sometimes. I need to lock screen and then turn it on to be workable. Maybe unstable Andriod Pie. Most hanged app - FB messenger
4. A bit large screen. You can't use it by one hand, provided you got medium sized hands.
5. Camera has issues in low light. Still better than Poco or Zenfone.
6. Selfie has some problem in artifical lights. The background is taken in low pixels. So, if someone is standing behind, he will not be as clear as other at front.
7. Woaah, the fingerprints it catches. Massive bro!
8. Water resistant huh? Really? Should give an IP rating.
9. Fingerprint is fast, no doubt. But sometimes, I have to tap twice or thrice over sensor to unlock.
10. I donno what security they uses for face unlock. It is lightning fast and even unlocks when not looking at it. Face unlock is weak security wise.
Give it a like if it serves your purpose.",4
"One of the best phone I bought. Best screen resolution, perfect camera with good battery life. Could not find any flaw.",5
Very good phone overall,5
"I got this under the festival season sale. Spending 32000 k for a 128GB product is not gonna happen all time. Thanks to Amazon for that. It reached me after 4 days (Even as a prime customer).
My was actually reluctant to give up my OP3T which was again a great phone. But if there is a good chance to upgrade then no one will loose it.
I think even now (When OP6T is around the corner) this mobile is worth to purchase..",5
Excellent value for money phone. Everything is perfect.,5
"Amazing phone, I've been using mid range Moto and Sony phones till now and thought of upgrading to a flagship level phone. This phone does live up to the hype and carries on the heritage and standards set by previous one plus phones like 5t and 5. I'll try to highlight a few pros and cons
Pros:
1.Excellent display
2.Flagship Snapdragon 845 Cpu- ensures excellent performance
3.6GB RAM- I bought the 6 gig version, I feel 6gigs are sufficient for graphic intensive gaming and multitasking. If you want more storage space, consider the 8gig RAM variant.
4.Oxygen OS: OnePlus has done a fabulous job with the oxygen OS, it is a refined version of Android, you get only the essential stuff on your phone minus the bloatware. Fluid UI, no lags, great optimisation. With Android pie, Battery life has improved.
5.Camera: Most of the buyers consider this to be a critical aspect while purchasing a phone. I'm not a Camera enthusiast but the dual cameras on this beast offer decent photography options.
6:Build quality: The phone has a glass back and the overall build quality matches phones that sell in the 40-50k range. Truly a Flagship killer.
7.Water resistance: The phone does offer a degree of water resistance, one plus says the phone can not be used underwater and there is no IP certification. So the phone is good enough only to withstand splashes and rain outings.
Cons:
1.Sound: Sound output through the loudspeaker could have been better.
Nothing else as of now",5
Over all best phone,5
Price is too bigh,5
Different from others,5
"Slow on camera ,while taking the pictures .. Not good as iPhone camera",4
I got my one plus 6  at Amazon festivel with in 1day I got delivery .when I open the box and use my lovely one plus I fall in love what a mobile at this price range am 100% satisfied having 1plus 6.,5

What i like about op 6 is that everything.,5
Less money more features,5

Low light camera is not good and stabilization while clicking photos is also not good....gives blur images even in normal clicks(not in potrait mode) clicking potrait mode is struggle as u have to keep subject within certain distance and that's too close...,5
"Picture quality is nyc
Sound is excellent battery lyf is ok",4
"I don't about others, but it's more than just a phone to me..",5
Display is just wow. Games play very smooth. No lags whatsoever. Dash charging is very fast. Expected a little bit more from the camera. My Note 5 pro takes better selfies.,4
Really awesome picture quality is marvellous battery life is not good because it's 8gb ram and 128gb memory so may be the battery should be given at least 3900mah but only 3300mah is provided and also there is no option to open front and back camera at a time coming to sound it's superb but single speaker is given there is no stereo and display is very good and coming to speed and gaming it is a king and also dash charging is excellent and camera quality is so nice overall it is budget oriented and value for money compared to other mobiles available in market,5
"Awesome product
Color is awesome
Only issue was otp for delivery got scrambled in msgs",5
Picture sound is very good,5
Sometimes slower down while playing games that's the only drawback of the phone,5

"Using the OnePlus 6 since 5 months.
Camera
The camera on OnePlus 6 is extremely good. Don't compare with the flagship from Samsung or Google, but the best in the available competition.
Battery Life
Battery life is decent. Not so good. But lasts a typical day.
Performance
This is one aspect where OnePlus is miles ahead of its competition. No lag. No frame drops. All games like Pubg work extremely fluid.",5
"Good mob with 8 Gb Ram. Value for money high end mob. Looks stunning with Corning glass 5 & red looks.Great speed. Downside:SMSs can't be locked from inadvertent delete, can't move files by select & move but has cut & then go & past in new folder.Not as user friendly as Samsung. Samsung software is way ahead but Ram less of Samsung. Doesn't have SdCard slot which is huge negative point as vital data can't be copied for posterity & incase mob goes bad which Chinese mobs including Oneplus are quite notorious.Last 3 mob of One plus in my family went usesless after 2 to 2.5 yrs with total loss of data.Contacts are visible throughout & can't be hidden. There is no speed dial lkie Samsung. Overall decent mob.",4

"It works well in most areas and with all apps. I find it so good I hardly have to pick up my other devices to see pages on the Internet. The only limitation is outside the range of broadband coverage the phone struggles. If you are on Wi-Fi at home, in the office, this is the best device to have. If you are moving around, I don't know how good it is.",5
A good deal,5

Poor,1
It is big broad to hold,4
"Needless to say the speed delivered to you is amazing. Never disappoints in any scenario. Amazing battery life runs for an average of 18-20 hours a day with still 20% left. Camera is top notch and performs very very well. Never had heating issues till date. Multitasking is a delight if you are into switching apps in between.
Only thing I felt bad is that gallery shows images from ads and cache as well and there is no option to hide it. Also there is no feature in built to move photos to another folder or create new album.",4

Nice one,4
Excellent battery life,5
No words for the phone.totally awesome.it passes all the criteria of a flagship smartphone.only little this are missing such as wireless charging features.oh common this much you can get with this amount of money.,5
"Got a faulty mobile I guess as camera automatically going shutting down time to time when try to take capture.
Sim network issue faced in slot 1 however sim is working fine in slot 2.
Battery backup is also not even full day if you go on a drive and it is must to carry dash charger. One my friend told me this is the cause due to pie updation and soon it will be resolved, hope so.
I talk to amazon and customer care representative scheduled a inspection for after three days. It is really wondering. Replace process is also full of frustrating.",1
"This is my second oneplus device after 5t, and it has not dissapointed me.
Its premium as usual and red color is just killing any other phone in looks.
Got this phone in killing price in great indian sale 2018 under exchange of my old mobile.
Its worth every penny..as it got sold out on first day of sale.
Only con in this phone is battery is same 3300 mah as 5t.
Which could have improved, otherwise this is a beast mobile.",5
Overall product is very good,5
"Cannot regret buying this phone.
Camera, battery, memory, performance everything at perfection.
No cons for my usage",5
"Very good phone, gives you premium feel.
Camera gives justification to its price.",5
"Check the photos I snapped using Oneplus 6 and you can judge it by yourself. Nowadays having depth in photos is very much trending, but the awesome thing which I personally like is the detailing of light the camera captured, never expected such awesome results. it can certainly compete with DSLRs in terms of composition. Apart from this very fast in focusing and capturing the image, that sunrise image I captured on moving vehicle, it's simply awesome.
Few other things which I find it unique and you won't find it any reviews are;
1. Text messages are automatically sorted in the inbox and it's easy to maintain important messages and notification SMS properly organized.
2. I have multiple Gmail accounts for official use and each account have multiple contacts stored in it, so after adding all those Gmail accounts in the phone it is only syncing contacts from my primary Gmail account and therefore my phone book contacts are not getting messed up.
3. Gesture control is awesome, it gives freedom to use the phone as per our ease and one can also customize it on different levels.
4. Network and internet speed is too good.
and I am sure there is much more in this phone as I will go exploring.
Apart from this, phone looks are pretty awesome and rich. It gives a premium feel and the phone is very much noticeable.
I am not a gamer so for me, battery is lasting almost 24 hours with frequent usage of fb, whatsapp, gmail, insta, google, skype and of course phone calls.
The only thing missing is an earphone, I think the company should provide that too, otherwise, phone comes with case cover and pre-installed screen protector.
Overall, you won't regret buying this phone. if you are landing in the range of 20-25k, then push a little bit and go for this phone it will be a paisa vasool for you.
I hope this review will be helpful.  Good Luck.",5

Even if the camera contains f/1.7 aperture its camera quality does not match with Samsung s7 and further series, probably its due to lack of dual pixel pdaf, hence is expected in its upcoming series.

"Best mobile in this range.
I was using iPhone 6 for past few years. Now I wanted a dual sim mobile and after going through many reviews and ratings this one seemed to be the best in my budget. Now I've been using this mobile for more than a week.
The battery stays for whole days use for a normal web users like me. Even if you use continuously for long hours, no worry you've dash charging which works too good. The camera quality is also good.  As the caption says the speed is also really fast. And speaker, thought the sound is not great, it is not bad either.
For those who are confused between 64 GB and 128 GB variant I would recommend normal users like those who use FB, instagram and very rare games, taking pictures once in a while go 64 GB, it is fine. If you're a heavy user, you download a lot, store lot of movies, store pictures for a long time can't transfer them to laptop or hard disk regularly (atleast 15 days once) only then opt for 128GB.
Drawback I felt is it is slightly over priced with no headphones and wide angle camera but as a overall product it is a value for money deal except that.",5
"Ok, fine",4
Butter smooth performance. Great display ...Only con is battery life.Love it.,5

"2 days initial review.
1- Delivery takes a entire week.
2- Phone box was little bit crushed on edges. Nitpicking though I feel it's bcoz of poor handling of the retailer.
3- Phone is fast. Got Android pie update. Felt some games are not optimized played Pokemon go and it doesn't play it in full screen . Even pubg had some minor stuters at first but now it runs smoothly.
4-Dash charge is best feature. It really does charge it real quick.
5- You need to get a scratch guard and a case immediately. Found minor scratches on 2 days use on the pre applied scratch guard. Case provided is good but I do prefer original op6 bumper case.
Will be posting full review after 1 month.",5

"This is a beast. You will never regret buying OnePlus 6. Picture quality is very nice. Adaptive display is very sensitive and responds immediately to any change in external light. It has only one speaker at the bottom left but sound quality is still good.
The only thing that I wanted to be better is the battery life. The battery is enough for one day if you use the device moderately.
Design is very premium. I purchased mirror black and the back of phone is really cool.",4

Loving this beast. Absolutely amazing in terms of display which is amoled and wallpapers look exceptionally stunning. The battery life is amazing with a full charge leaving you with 30% at night. Also an update is available for Android P which provides a adaptive battery technology which works really well. Picture quality through rear camera is great. Front is nice too. Dash charger charges it to full in less than an hour. Features are great and it is a standout. I have a mirror black one 8 gb varient. In a nutshell the phone is Amazing and is way fast.,5
Good phone for the price,4
Value for money,5
Picture quality good,5
"The phone is absolutely excellent. But my bad luck,  Had big scratch on the screen. apparently it comes with a pre applied screen protector The Amazon customer care is not aware of this fact which led to a lot of hassle. I cross checked with OnePlus customer care and local authorised centre for this and kept the product.
Lesson learnt: amazon customer is not fully aware of the product specs and be very careful before you make a purchase.
Kudos to OnePlus team for a great phone.",4
"I like the features except the camera quality it's need to improve.
Thanks",5
Brilliant phone.....value for money....battery could have been better....dash charging makes up for it....,5
"One plus 6 (8gb)mobile is wonderful in price range of 30-35k . Having good photo quality, and battery life. Screeen pixel density(ppi) is not so good. Even quality of sound can be better. Hope fully oneplus 6t will have all features with better sound quality and screen ppi.",3
Best phone!!!,4
I am satisfied,5
Top.top,5
"One plus 6 is ""The Best flagship"". It's Speed is awesome. I mean it is the fastest phone in market. My friends who use iPhone are now in love with One plus 6. I will just note down the best things I found in this phone:
1)Best Picture Quality: One Plus is well known for its Camera quality. My clicks are just awesome with it.  Soon we are getting Nightscape update.
2) Excellent Battery life: Power management is extremely good. I have used Xiaomi phone with 4000mAh battery but despite of having 3300mAh battery one plus 6 lasts a little long for day.
3)Dash charging is like cherry on the cake.
4) Sound quality is even better than Samsung Galaxy S9 and many in the market
5) Speed: With Snapdragon 845 processor and 6 Gb ram you won't find any lag. Truly it gives the speed that you need.
Overall I am Fully satisfied by holding Most Admired flagship of World.",5

"Really nice phone for the price. The quality is really amazing. Great to have an out of the box guard. The dash charger is amazing. I was initially pessimistic about the battery backup due to its on-paper capacity, but the practical backup coupled with the dash charging is literally the best. The camera is really precise. I'm not an expert but it's gives really sharp pictures, has lots of options and doesn't get heat up even after extended long periods of video shooting and casual gaming. The speaker is also great(it would be better if they weren't mono speakers though) . Honestly speaking, I moved up from Moto g4 plus to this device so everything feels much superior but it's definitely value for money",5
"Thanks Amazon for delivery within 24 hrs after placing order. I got 64GB variant in great indian sale at 26k and I m happy with the OnePlus 6.
OnePlus is launching 6T so strategically are not selling 64GB variant.
Everything about this phone is best in the market. .Camera quality is like dslr camera. Enough details after zooming out.

"All of my prior phones were iPhones with the exception of a Samsung that was used as a backup. I was a bit hesitant to make the leap to Andriod. Having done it, I do like this phone after I have used it for 3 weeks. The interface is clean and functional. The screen is nice and bright. It has a very snappy response. The amount of storage is perfect for my use. The camera is excellent. The call quality is pretty good. I have had no issues with connecting to bluetooth devices.
I cant speak about gaming as I dont play any.",5

"Bought this phone from store 2 days ago got it for 35k
So if you want to buy this phone, buy it from store.
This phone is awesome in two days of use I'm in love with oxygen os. It's simple yet smart. Got Android P update too!
U don't have to care about it's performance. It's a beast. There are no apps on play store that can hang this machine!
The camera quality is not that great campared to other high end devices but it's not bad either. If you are coming from phone under 20-25k then you will love this camera.
It's a stock Android (not Android one, that's different!) + Got 1080p display + SD845 processor + super fast fast charging.... So you don't have to worry about it's battery.
If you have budget for this, then go ahead and buy it!
One plus 6T has just minor improvements over this one, if you don't want to spent 4-5k then buy this, you will never regret it!",5
The performance is flawless.,5
Speed of the phone is just mindblowing. Sound quality is average but not bad. Display is outstanding at this price range.,5
"Picture quality: superb
Sound quality: superb
Battery life: easily getting 2 days life without charging again.
I was MI note 4 user and moved to oneplus 6 because of network problem faced in MI phone. I was using different MI phones for 4 years but I am seeing there is a big quality concern over poor phone call and build quality. My friend is using one plus 3t for 2 years and his son is throwing his like a stone but I did not find any damage. I was impressed with oneplus build quality.",5

I was expecting better camera and sound quality from this device but when I hold this one in my hand I realized it's not up that level. Sound quality is not Dolby and the speaker position is not friendly i.e. when you play game or watching movies it's blocking the speaker location. Camera quality is also not good in term of zooming.,5
"Smooth, faster, amazing",5

"oneplus 6
only one word - U NAILED IT!!
maan what a phone..
i jumped from iphone 6
so this is the flagship killer i guess they say n i tell u they r damn true!!
damn those looks !!
display is absolutely stunning..u ll jst fall for superamoled clarity !!
battery life coupled with that beast dash charge is unbeatable
damn that snapdragon 845 !!
didnt test the camera..ll update soon..but saw in videos n it beats iphone x and other flagships (not pixel though)
ppl compain abt the sound quality..there ws jst this thing stopping me from buyin this beautiful beast..but i think i made a right choice buying this..they say iphones hav better quality..but u wont regret by the quality it gives..sound quality is superb in headphones (both bluetooth n audio jack) n even the speakers are descent and they are very clear..ppl say abt distortion..they are wrong..i fell in love with this beauty..so smooth it blazez thru evrything..pubg in top graphics what n experience!!!
i ll update after a couple of months usage..for now i ll giv it 10/10 !!
PS- the screen guard that it gives with phone is so durable its been almost 2 months n its working fine..respect!!",5
"I'm loving it, best phone ever had.
Awesome feel. Fastest processor, even though company doesn't gives ip certification it has the ability to survive in water.
Go for it.",5
Tremendous,5
One plus is the best,5
Brightness is too less sound quality not good and battery is very fastly discharge,3
Best android phone.,5
Everything is good.,5
Its very very awesome,5
"The Phone Overall is A Beast we all know..!
But everything is not perfect in this after using for more than a 1 month I can say it.
Pro's:-
Screen Quality:- 10/10 (Very Crisp and Sharp, Optic Amoled helps a Lot)
Sound- speaker is Very Loud and Clear.Dual speaker should have been given in this price but no matter, its not a deal breaker.(9/10)
Camera - One of the Most Unique and Awesome thing of OP 6 i can say now. picture are very brighter and Range is Very Good even you zoom it.Specially in Day light,The photos are just Fantastic.Front Camera is Very Good for Selfies.Bokeh mode for both rear and front is Awesome,edge detection is superb.Video is also very Stable.(20/10)
Calling- Using both Vodafone 4G and Jio 4G continuously.have no issues with it.Finely working,speaker is also loud and clear for hearing.(10/10)
Alert Slider- Very Useful Implementation (10/10)
Updates- After Buying a New phone,Updates matter the most.and Yes,I can definitely say, Oneplus keeping their promises by giving major and Minor Updates.Just Receives Android 9.0, 3 weeks ago.This is only the 7th phone to get this Update in India.
Box Contains and Accessories:- All things Are rightly given in box,the preapplied screen guard,The Back cover is just Outstanding,and the Awesome Dash charger.
I already Got SandStone cover in free with Phone when I bought it.after One month I bought Original Oneplus Avenger's Edition back cover Which is Love to me.
Con's -
Battery Life - Mostly A weak point for this device.For casual use it will last for full day but you have to charge it in night I'm sure.and if u r a heavy user, you will be very Disappointed with it.As it is running with world's Top most Processor and GPU,battery sucks up quite easily.and Also After Pie(Android 9.0),Battery life is Not stable at all.
But,afterall You have Dash charger in your hand,which is just extraordinary.
(Over all 7/10)
Auto brightness- Not very well calibrated Even in Pie,but still managble,I'm not saying that it's worst,but it should be better.i think OP will fix it in future Updates.
Headphone jack- Though the phone have it,but still it is not Outstanding.The beats are flat.i have Heavy Sony's Headphone,still Don't get the true beats frm it.
Overall Rating i will give (9.5/10)..If you have budget,Just go with it.None can beat this,in this range.You are getting a Lot,and also Oneplus Community is there in side.The Camera is Just Hats off!",5
"Picture quality is good, better than midrangers. But below Samsung S9 or Pixle 2. Speakers lack punch, but alright for the average users. Battery life steals the show, averaging 5+ hours on moderate use.",5
"Unbeatable at this price point, though was gutted to know that a few weeks after i bought it, it's price was further reduced by 5k.",5
Best mobile I bought till date. Have all features what one can expect in this range.,5
I heard very good about one+ and 6 to be very special. But my experience is literally screwed cause it's only 2nd week and device gets freezed in between. really a bad experience.,1

"Picture quality is nice i. E. Screen looks vibrant and shows a lot more colour than other phones(I compared to one plus 2, my old phone). Sound is loud and crystal clear. Battery charges fast. Could have opted for 6T but selected this since 3.5mm headphone jack was my priority over other features.",5
Worth üí∞,5
"Well, you know that feeling of awesomeness, when you get more than what you expect, this is what it is for me with this fantastic device.
Brief background: I've been the most loyal Iphone customer- bought each and every iphone device till 6S when it got launched and in the process spent a lot of money imagining I am 'investing' in the best. I loved iphone for their robustness and simplicity (yawn), and style (really).
This time around, I compared various devices: Iphone X, S9, Huawei phones and OnePlus 6 and wanted to break through my loyalty by buying a non apple product. It wasn't a simple choice to switch your loyalty, so has to be really an upswing to convince me.
I tested most of the products and ended up buying OnePlus 6. Below is the summary of Considerations, expectations and outcome after 2 weeks of using the device. I will compare it to my iphone 6S as that was my going out model.
1. Speed: I need good speed- as I do multiple things, apps, bookings, payments, excel sheets, ppt presentations, all thru the phone. I m not a gamer but probably use up more bandwidth and compute than what gamers do.
My iphone tired me no end and I believe the lack of compatability will make my iphone x experience similar if not worse.
Oneplus simply blew me away- blazing speed, accuracy, I don't make spelling mistakes when I write ( somehow I feel the keyboard is arranged suberbly well- Iphone was a disaster for me). The phone solved multiple small things for me- taking long screenshots, faster operations. I somehow feel, that my internet speed (dumber), is faster on Oneplus than Iphone.
2. Build: I wanted a phone just like iphone that's robust and strong. One Plus 6 is much better, sturdier and the touch-feel is superb.
3. Charging/Battery: Biggest concern with Iphone was the battery life and it still is for most apple devices. Oneplus is blazing fast charging with dashcharger, holds charge for atleast 1 day for me with extreme usage of the device. ( I use my phone for professional usage) v/s an Iphone 6s which would not even last me with 2.5 hrs of charge.
The charging cable is very robust, the charge connector all- are pretty high grade.
4. Photos/Pictures/Scan: My iphone 6S wasn't bad and I've seen Iphone X which is good but I wanted REAL like feel- finished and touched up a bit to give a ready to serve picture. Oneplus 6 exceeds my requirements here. Pics of my newborn daughter come out very neat and deep. The depth feature (probably using the 2nd camera) is amazing and the pictures does show her hair over the face, dimples and smirks.. basically if you are able to see the emotions thru the portrait - that defines the pic more than the mega pixels.
5. Size: Obviously the size is much better than iphone 6S whilst any other device could match it. Though the screen clarity and videos through my prime video are flawless - better than tv lcd.
4. Price: an obvious one- is super attractive for the device. With loads of features and high build grade, It definitely will make apple run for the money.
The only aspect that I miss are original oneplus earphones that should come with the device to make it a well packaged device to use.
Overall I think, I made a superb choice with this device. To me, if an Iphone X and OP 6 come within the same price range for similar specs, I would definitely still choose OP for it's speed, built and quality.
Wishing OP all the best. Please connect if you need any more details on phone usage or unique features or use cases",5
Superb phone.,5
"Best one in this price range. many channels on YouTube claiming that it's not heating during playing games when it's charging is wrong.

"Processor speed, RAM management, Camera, Display, Battery; The OnePlus will not disappoint us in any of these aspects.
Since OnePlus X, the OnePlus 6 is the only phone in their series to feature a glass body and it makes it the sexiest Flagship from OnePlus.
The built is very premium and stylish. There is no better option in this price range. Just go for it. Trust me! It's my 3rd OnePlus. You'll never regret buying a OnePlus.",5
Good battery life but can be better,5

Fabulous mobile,5
"First of all my grievance is that i had ordered it on 10th of August and after 3days seller has shipped this order, may be it is because of sale. But the delivery boy is awesome and nice to talk with he suggested me to open the box in front of him and took video of that also. I have to say that the phone is very premium and nice to hold. Screen quality is just awesome but the battery life is not that great it is not bad but not as expected when you have AMOLED display but the charger that comes in a box is fabulous. Everything is great in this phone considering price. You can purchase this phone blindly.",5
Requirement of battery life is more,4
"Bought this phone about a 6month ago and this is my opinion after using it for a 6month.
Really it's smart phone .
About hardware:
The outer case is premium in feel and touch. The display ratio to body is perfect. You won't notice any borders as such on all corners. Display is pretty vivid and touch is suoer responsive. The device feels sturdy enough to handle small and medium impacts. The side buttons are easy to operate and does not feel too soft or too notchy either.
Camera:
Camera is not super but definitely a good one. There are lot of ootions in Pro mode just like we get un DSLR. You can set everything custom as per your requirement like focus, aperture, ISO, shutter soeed etc which eill results in very customisable photos.
Sound and Microphone:
Siund at loudspeakers are perfect and audible even in crowded places. Earpiece for calling fullfills the expectatios. Since Oneplus dies not provide the headphones in box, you can use any 3.5 mm headphones. I am using Apple earpods with thus device with no issues for music and calling and the music experience is not different than any iOS device.
Battery backup:
I simoly love the dadh charging technology of this device. It charges uoto 40 prr cent of battery just in 10 minutes. Overall battery backuo is upto the mark. A single charge will be sufficient with heavy internet usage for a day.
Overall performance:
Yes. This device does heats up a bit when you play any high end games for approx 30 minutes which is very natural as you are using all it's components at extereme levels for better gaming experience. But again, even the battery performance is suoerb for gaming too.
Few areas for improvement:
There are some areas in terms of user UI experience which Oneplus needs to improve a bit. Like other Android devices, this also keeps a lot of garbage files on you ROM which you need to clear time to time. Of course, it won't cause any slowness but it will definitely occupy a space on your ROM.
FINAL verdict:
I woukd definitely recommend this device because even other high end Android devices does not cone uo with such configuration at this orice tag. Snapdragon 845 with 640 GPU packed with 6/8 GB RAM is an astonishing combination in this price bucket.

"This is my first chance with One Plus device and pretty good one so far. The screen, though not as good as Samsung or iPhones, is pretty good and has decent sunlight legibility. So far, excellent battery life. Easily lasts a day+. Most of the performance and processing is very good but I have noticed lags with camera. Actually clicks the photo after few fractions of a second. Also, not very happy with the camera UI. No settings to choose/reduce MP values or no features such as filters and greyscale mode. Correct me if I am missing anything in the camera but certainly not happy with camera app. Another thing missing is expandable storage. Really wish it was available. But otherwise a very decent phone. Looks really good in hand with big display and with hidden notch.",4

Charging 0-100 takes around 80mins.
Screen - touch and feel is good.

Best phone,5
"Value for money , good product go for it
 got it at 35k",4
"So i am writing this review after using the device for 1 week on Android pie (9.0):
Pros:
1) The amoled screen on this device is best in the class offers great viewing angles with deep black.
2) Battery on this device is just awesome i am getting over 6+hrs sot every time with gaming around an hour.
3) Speaker output is good considering single bottom firing speaker.
4) Camera on this device is good,takes some good day and night time photos.
5) Dash charge is awesome charges the phone completely in 70min.
6) Got this in awesome deal from amazon.
Now cons:
1) Output via 3.5mm headphone jack is bad ,i tried different earphones ranging from 2k to 12k but believe me audio is worst part of this device.
2) Glass back is a finger print magnet so use it with the supplied case in the box.
3) Bokeh effect/depth effect is a hit or miss from both cameras.
I will update this review if i find any cons in the future.",4
SPEED U NEED,5
It's OnePlus Up to It's Standards,4
"Everything is absolutely great about this phone! Battery backup could be a bit more. But anyway, I haven't faced a battery drain ever and having a really good experience with this phone.",5
"Bought this for my dad who was using Samsung S5 previously & was really frustrated with its battery backup and tendency to hang. I was skeptical about shifting him to this brand as he is very choosy about brands. But finally went for it after reading and viewing 100s of reviews and honestly after about 15 days of usage this hasn't disappointed on any front.
Its ultra smooth, superb picture quality, no problem with sound output, beautiful build and display even outdoors, long lasting battery etc. It is more then worth for this money. Even now I am planning to shift from samsung note 3 to next flagship of one plus",5

Build is amazing and you will feel it when you hold it. Although you will have to be extra careful while using with or without a case. Glass body

If the cost get reduced by 3k-5k, it's THE BEST value for money smartphone.
PS: Mine is 6GB, 64GB device. I would've loved it if it had been 6GB, 128GB configuration. As I and most of the people I've known who have bought it are not high end users, and the device lacks extra memory slot, OnePlus can consider this feedback in future.",5

"First of all kudos to Amazon for providing great deal and timely delivery. I got this one for 27k and received package within 24 hours of placing order.
Now about phone, first impression is about the great screen. I've always been a fan of an Amoled display just because they offer deep blacks. Oneplus 6 is having really nice display with a notch (I don't have a problem with notch display). Great viewing angles and Color reproduction.
About performance, its Qualcomm's current year's flagship SDM845 so obviously no lag at all.
The camera, it's great even in low light photography thanks to the wide f/1.7 aperture. Edge detection is accurate in portrait pictures.
The battery, it's nice as well if not great. I am getting a full day of battery life on 90% charge with around 5.5 hours of screen on time. And the dash charging, it is the most amazing thing about this device. It charges the phone about 65-70 % in 30-35 minutes which is great!
The only con is that speaker output is not good at all. And the glass back is fingerprint magnet and seems fragile so we can't use the phone without a case.",5
"Cam is very good but always on display does not work properly, battery life is good",4
"The device works great & delivery was on time.
The dash charging is awesome.",5

"Superb phone, camara quality is very good, battery life is 2days for normal users. Thank you Amazon I am happy for this product.",5
Mindblowing but the price drop 5000 in the sale,5
"I think OnePlus 6 is by far the best device to ever come out from the OnePlus family. Yes OnePlus 6T will take over but this was a great deal. I have upgraded to the latest Android P and it works wonder on this device. Evrrybody knows the configuration of the device so there is no much to talk about it but what matters is the brand providing you all this at a price range of just 35k. During the sale, the price dropped to 29,999/- but still other devices with the same configuration charge more than 50k so if you are a geek who understands electronics, you will never buy something just for the sake of the brand. Coming to the OnePlus 6 camera, I think it can click some of the most amazing pictures, breathtaking slow motion videos and other smooth videos with the help of inbuilt stabilizer. Dash charger is damn quick. Just more than an hour to charge from 0 - 100%. Being a food blogger and budding filmmaker, camera is my most important feature on this device but also being a complete enthusiast for games, it's Snapdragon 845 delivers to the promise with no lags even on heavy games like PubG and others. I would have loved to see IP68 Certification for water resistance but at this price tag, it's already a more than par device.",5

"Finally after oneplus 2 this is my 2nd oneplus device i didn't had the good time handing oneplus 2 because of the infamous sd 810 but this is truly a beast it serves everything it's made for. Lately I was using lg g6 and nokia 8 and these are my thoughts after using it for 5 days.
DESIGN
It's the best looking smartphone in this range the premium finishing and glass back makes it really eye catching but the metal part looks fragile at the same time the color looks to be easily scratchable.
DISPLAY
It has one of the best 1080p AMOLED panel colors are crisp and vibrant but i miss the sharpness of ips displays
BATTERY
I am easily getting 6 hours of SOT but i am not a hardcore user  standby time and everything is at top and not to forget dash charger this thing is special
CAMERA
Pictures qualities are good they have depths in it as far my usage it gets the job done
SOFTWARE
I was really excited about that part of this phone because of its closeness to stock Android and  it's smooth buttery smooth but have some bugs in pie i can see lags and stutter time to time. Gestures are not optimised completely and it's just doesn't feel original like i was using in nokia 8 which is android one device.
PERFORMANCE
6gb ram and sd845 nothing to say anything here.
My final thoughts
I got this Device for 27000rs and it's the best you can get for this price as far as i can tell a premium design amoled display and top notch performance but i wouldn't have bought it for 35000rs it doesn't justify 35000 imo display could be better build quality could have been better i know software bugs would be iron out with time. Lg g7 would be the best choice if you are going to spend this much of money",5
"I will come to technical review ..
1. Awesome package of performance and quality.
2. Battery charging is like fast as flash
3. Little more battery.. would be make it a "" char Chand lag jaye"".",5
The product is good and I'm  satisfied with it but I did'nt  got handset in the box. every thing eles is good,4

"Thanks to Amazon for delivering the phone before Our Durga Puja Festival;that too just in three days and during the AMAZON GIF I got this flagship phone at the lowest price ever (‚Çπ 27999 bundled with ‚Çπ 1000 cash back as APB) üòä
About the phone I must mention that the Glass Back Look is so stylish and beautiful ‚ù§ ‚ù§ It is so shiny and awesome.
Performance wise this is a BEAST as everyone knows with its specification.And I just have updated my phone to ANDROID 9.0 PIE with Oxygen O.S 6.0 üòä
Picture Quality is excellent with the front and rear camera both.
Surely I would like improvement in Sound Quality with stereo sound effect in near future.
Dash charging process is the BEST I have ever seen and it roughly takes One and half hour to get fully charged üòä But I think a 4000 mAH battery would have been more apt with such a high quality phone.
Overall I am pretty happy for now and looking forward to use it as it is meant for: THE SPEED U NEED üòä",5
All is good,5
Sound quality can be better,5
No stereo speaker (The only con),5
All good,4
"I was using Nexus 5x a Stock Android Phone. When i bought this, i was  bit sceptical  with regards to the Camera,Display and The Stock android experience. Even though it is not Stock Android, I am Very Comfortable with the UI on ONE PLUS. Moving on, the battery life is Amazing it gives me about 1 Complete day regular usage(Without Gaming), If i switch on the battery saver it gives me roughly more than 1 and half day for my usage. Camera is Good but not that great(as compared to high end devices like samsung s9 or note and even pixel 3xl) and the Display is quite Bright and can been used in daylight. The processor is quite fast with 6gb RAM. One plus 6 is just a premium phone bundled at a Mid Range Price!!!",5

"I have been using Iphone for a very long time. Then I thought of using android phone but was not able to choose a best phone for my self. Then one of my friend suggested me Oneplus. So I purchased Oneplus 3T and I was amazed by its performance. I have been using Oneplus 3T for almost 2 yrs then thought of upgrading to Oneplus 6. This was best decision for me. I have been using it from last 2 months now. Battery life amazing last for one and a half day on 4G. Camera superb. RAM 6GB has never let me down.
Thank you Oneplus for making such an amazing phone. One of the best phone in Android.",5
Good product,5
Very good,5
Fabulous phone...,5
"Comparing to one plus 5T , I liked the 5T better than 6 regarding screen brightness and battery back up though both one plus 5T and 6 had same battery configuration but there is a lot of difference in battery performance 5T last much longer than 6 I would say if 5T has a moderate 2o hours battery whereas one plus 6 lasts only 15 hrs. which is huge difference for same configuration, one plus 6 also does not feature fingerprint sliding gesture which is a cool feature on one plus 5T.
some feature are good in one plus 6 such as front portrait camera and  hiding notch display . It is copairtively a bit faster than one plus 5t.",4
"The product is awesome, fast charging doesn't realise u that u r having battery of low power.
But the offer which Amazon was giving during purchase was a bluff, which they played very well, this doesn't suit Amazon seriously disappointed.",4
"Very responsive, voice assistant is too good, good quality camera. I think the phone is very stable.
Only compliant is : the back panel made of glass is too delicate. My phone which is just (5 days old) has fallen from 2 feet and the back glass broke (despite being covered in a case)
I think they should go with a metal back or toughened glass.",4
Very nice.. really appreciate your work OnePlus.. it's an great experience which will be continue for more,5

Rest RAM management is great till now no hanging issue reported yet, it is working like a Butter so smooth ..",5
Best phone,5
"It worth for money.
1. The quality of the picture in day time or light vision was so good. But the picture during night mode or low light, it's not good.
2. The front camera was good enough during both mode. Sound was good. Battery  life stays for a day, if both internet options WiFi and mobile data is enabled. The battery life could have been better.
3. The back cover comes with box fits perfectly which makes us statisfy. All the 4 Conners were well designed. Its quiet difficult to hold as size is big, but it's good for movies.
4. Processor is designed well which maintains the fast and not like any another product which gets slow down after few days.
5. Headset is missing, but not a big deal. We can choose suitable one from market per requirement. Inbuilt radio option is missing which is quiet disappointment
Phone heats quiet and battery stays for a day.
Feeling little difficult to use Android as new OS and using Apple products previously",4
All the things are very good it is the best phone it's camera sound and battery life is amazing . It has dash charging rapid charging . Now one plus 6t will come at 30/10/2018 it will be a best phone I think I recommend that who will buy this phone or iPhone will be very happy,5

"Worth all the hype around it, clicks nice pictures, UI is the best I have ever seen, I have used quick charge before but dash charge is something else. Comes with pre-installed tampered glass and a rubber case so u don't have to spend anymore money. There are 2 other options at this price range which are cheaper so is their buid quality, and none have amoled panels, It isn't called a flagship killer for no reason, this comeptes with flagship devices in both specs and built quality, so if you are looking for a phone to stick to for the next few years go for this phone.",5

The picture quality is much improved compared to older one plus devices. Although the charging is quite fast I wish the battery was bumped a bit more to 4000mah or so. Sound is loud and sharp. Performance is blazing fast. Definitely Recommend.,5

Mind-blowing,5
"Just switched from the Poco F1 to the OnePlus 6. Both phones are excellent, but the OnePlus 6 is slightly better imo. This review intends to solely compare the OP6 to the Poco F1.
Poco F1 -
Pros-
1. Price - Unbeatable price!
2. Battery - The 4000 MAH battery of the Poco is an absolute delight. It lasted me 1 1/2 days of moderate to heavy usage, as compared to 1 day with the OnePlus 6.
3. IR face unlock - the face unlock on the Poco is better than the OP6 imo. It works in pitch dark settings and is faster. (Note: OP6 face unlock is also very very good, don't get me wrong!)
4. Speakers - The stereo-like speakers on the Poco trump the OP6's below average speakers.
5. Liquid cooling - I haven't tested the OP6 with heavy gaming so can't comment for the OP6, shall update after doing so. However, heavy gaming on the Poco is a joy, no heating whatsoever.
OnePlus 6- apart from the above features, the OnePlus 6 beats the Poco F1 hands down.
Pros-
1. Screen - AMOLED, much natural Colors and darker blacks.
2. Oxygen OS - much better than MiUI, cleaner with faster updates. Already have 9.0 Pie on my OnePlus 6, still waiting for the Poco update. Also, the gestures and other features on Oxygen OS are incredible.
3. Camera - again, haven't tested the OP6 camera heavily, so shall update when I do so. This one's a really close call. I really liked the Poco camera, but from my initial impressions, the OP6 just beats it.
4. Dash Charge - absolutely insane speed! Much better than the Poco quick charger.
5. Water resistance - although there is no official IP rating for the OnePlus, YouTube videos and reviews prove otherwise. The OP6 is as good as water resistant. The Poco, on the other hand, is not even splash proof.
6. Looks - the OnePlus is a much better phone in terms of looks and feel. I also love the alert slider on the OnePlus 6.
7. Price - Got the OnePlus 6 for a great price in the great Indian sale! For the sale price, I would blindly go with the OnePlus 6 over the Poco F1.
Performance - tie. Same processors, same results! Both are blazing fast. They breeze through anything you throw at them.
Conclusion - both are great phones, but if you manage to get your hands on a OP6 during the Amazon sale, I would go ahead and buy the OnePlus over the Poco without thinking twice!",5

Thanks Amazon for giving op6 for 27k. This makes it a great deal considering how refined the product feels. Got Android p update soon as the phone has been set up. This phone has very few shortcomings and it feels very premium. Highlight of this phone is definitely oxygen os. This is a very good rom with many interesting touches.

"I have had been wanting to purchase oneplus phone for a while, had diviated after oneplus 2, but then, notch came, of which i wasn't a big fan of, waited for 6t, realised notch still there, and jack is being removed, happily took oneplus 6. It's pretty much an exceptionally good phone with a display, I mostly get mesmerised by, the duality of photo and video is pretty much as per my expectations, I'd love some more control over slow motion and timelapse though, but maybe after an update?
I've hit it with every heavy hd game I could find, and it worked happily, once after the initial loading, pubg loads in less than 10 seconds! Oh, and my antutu benchmark came as 2,90,000 or so :3 I'd say, if you're not interested in not having a jack port, and If you don't really care much about inbuilt finger print, you can go for this, though, perhaps 6t might have the new apeture settings which samsung has brought out, meh.",5

Interface, camera quality, battery and overall performance is just wow!",5
"I‚Äôve read a lot of positive reviews about this phone - and they‚Äôre all true. Great camera quality and very elegant to look at. The screen size is great (similar to the iPhone X‚Äôs) and gives the phone screen a bigger feel.
I bought this as a gift for my father - he had a lesser priced mi phone - and this seems like such a wonderful upgrade of quality. Totally worth it - and it was on sale on amazon. So yay!! And perfect timing on the Delivery.. no issues with the service.",5

"Let's start with the entire purchasing experience.
With the much hype around I decided to invest 27k into this so called popular product.
1. Delivery -
One day delivery turned into a 3 day delivery and the courier guys asked me to come to my office on a Saturday to pick up the product.
2. Packaging -
The product box seemed as it has been bitten by dogs or tossed around multiple times before being handed over to me.
3. Dusty & Soiled outside
The entire outside bag was soiled & full of dust. Remember its an item with 35k value
4. Phone - Pictures
This phone comes to at par with the likes of POCO & HONOR made devices. I have done technical evaluation of the pictures and their data. Don't know why should someone pay 15 k more for the similar aspects.
5. Oxygen OS
This is to plain and simple and doesn't allow much customisation.
6. Speaker
External down firing speakers are average and doesn't seems that they are a part of 35k phone.
7. Battery drains very fast so you have to utilise your jumbo charger very often in a day, such a pain.
Moreover AMAZON says you can't post negative reviews about delivery and experience as per them that are least bothered about it.
Spend 20k on POCO and get relatively same specs and save your money for future add one.",1
Too costly . Didn‚Äôt like it. Avoid,1
Nice phone..,5
"Awesome phone. Thank you Amazon for quicker delivery. Android pie with great battery life with smart display, I just love the phone.",5
I can play ping in ultra HD graphics,5

"I m using one plus x had no issues
But one plus which I had for one day only
Had following issues
1 Flickering 2 Brightness 3 Blue tooth logo was not detected.
Thanked to Amazone they had taken back.",1
Everything works fine...,5
Price is best,5
I was a fan of OnePlus from OnePlus 2. OnePlus provides the best specs for its mobiles. OnePlus 6 is no exception from this. Display is super. Camera is also fine. Oxygen skin makes OnePlus stand in the crowd.,5
areas around camra sensors are getting heated within 15 minuted of usage.,1
"Flawless. Just flawless. There is nothing more that you could ask for in a phone, that too at a steal price. I got this for a net Rs. 26700, including all the cashbacks and discounts availed. I have never been so satisfied with a purchase.",5
itz been more than a month one plus 6 is gng great üòçbest to buy,5

I like the phone because it's photo quality is very nice üëçüëçüëçüëç,5
"The speed, notch display, user-friendly features, et al are up to expectations. The build quality seems fine but could have been better as compared to Apple finish in build design. Or else, it's fine. This is Android king yet Apple is Apple.",5
Just Got it out of the box and it started heating near the camera but i rebooted the device and now its ok still heating but not much.,3
"Dash charger is amazing.
Earphone is missing in the box..",5

"Killer phone. The finger print sensor on the back is a pain, otherwise it's a fantastic phone.",5
"Oneplus is at its best üëçüèº I've used almost all the oneplus devices and OP6 is by far one of the best after oneplus 3t. Worthy for price ( quality and performance). Back case is a must ( I use the Avengers Ironman case) which I would recommend for day to day use.
Oneplus 6 = smooth +elegant + top notch performance",5
Good,5
Very good quality and stylish looking.,4
"I have been a fan of Redmi phones for some time now.

For the phone: I don't really need to add much to it. Ya'll see it on reviews on Youtube and how fast this beast is. BTW, Android Pie comes right away after first boot as an update. Everything is smooth and worth every penny. Kudos OP teams.",5

-Mobile performance unbelievable..
as we got 6 gb ram performance is too good
-Battery life is aslo good...100% ok for whole day...of ur use is tooo much then we have dash charging..
-10 15 min get 15 20 %charging..Not fix but approximately..last 10 15 %means after 85 90% mobile start trickle charging.
-Camera quality is faaadu means tooo good.
butttt if u want pic like dslr means too much blur u will have bad experience.
-Camera don't have any type of filter
-I didn't take any kind of selfie of my own cause mobile didn't have any type of filter üò§
-Many apps not supported to this device
like insta. it get stopped automatically.
-We got silent and normal mode button like iphone
-Zoom quality of camera is tooo good
-i like Mi a1 mobile as compare in camera quality
*after all if u r battery lovers then go for 1+
*if u r taking photos lover then go for another one...like mi a1 a2
*if u r lover of speed then go for 1+
after i buy one+6 in 35k mobile price decrease at only 30k üò§üò§üò§ Get tooooo Anger
After using 1+ now decide to sell it again and go for any Mi mobile
-If u r too rich means u don't know the real price of 35 or 30k then and only then go for 1+",3
Best phone,5
"Was really confused between Zenfone 5z and Oneplus 6 for more than 2 weeks. Went for OP6 consider better updates support, design and class. Both phones are equally good, I must say as my friend got Zf5z and I have used it extensively.",5

"In Short:
Build - premium
Looks - out of the mill + notch (got used to it sooner than expected)
Software - Oxygen (Pie (first OTA update)) ~ buttery smooth !
Battery - lasts a day
Colour - mirror black (I love the gloss)
Screen - good (tradeoff for battery (some thing I am ok with))
Camera - Whoa (coming from OP3T) diff feels like day and night
PS: added few more gesture tricks out of the box, should make life easier and faster.
Benchmarks :
Antutu - ranks 2 in my case and 4 overall in  benchmark, leaving behind S9s, SG Note9, P20, Pixels, POCO, HONORetc. Beats >99% Android phones.
Geekbench4 - OP3~7185, OP5~8069, OP6-13210 (whopping increase of 500 points).
 Wish I could add more benchmark details as why OP6 is what it is (App as of now only allows 1 picture).
Just go for it, Amazon Sale + exchange (OP3T) made the deal I couldn't refuse = only 21899‚Çπ for (6/64) model !!",5

Overall Product is good but disappointed by not Receiving headphone as mentioned in Amazon Website.,4
I never used any phone better than this beast .,5
"Bought this Flagship smartphone from OnePlus 3 months back and here are my observations after using it for 3 months.
1. Camera is just fabulous. It works like a DSLR with the inbuilt features that are available in DSLR. It supports features like focus, aperture, ISO etc can set all those features custom as per our requirement.
2. Sound and Microphone quality is just awesome and it is audible even in crowded places. Earpiece is good to take calls with nice and clear volume ratio. Earphones are not their in box quite disappointing after paying much but you can use any 3.5 mm jack earphones of good sound quality. There is no issues found for music as well you can experince calling and music as an IOS device (Apple) supports.
3. In love with its battery backup and dash charging technology. It charges almost 60% of phone battery in just 15 mins. Battery backup is awesum as a full charge of it lasts for a full day along with heavy internet usage. Comes with 3300 mAH lithium Polymer battery.
4. Best gaming experience ever compared to all other smartphones I used to play games earlier in phones from such good brands like Nokia, Samsung, MI, and even Apple iPhone 7. You can enjoy playing high end games like PUBG one of the trending games nowadays.
5. No heating problem faced while using it for long hours with heavy apps, games and internet surfing. Its a reliable phone.
6. There are lot of trash files stored on phone's RAM which needs to be cleared time to time so that it will not cause any slowness while operating the phone.
7. It looks very classy when holding in hand as well as its outer case is very comfortable in feel & touch. Display ratio perfectly fits its design as there are no borders. Touch is vivid and highly capacitive 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 5 used on both the front and back so no chances of screen tempering even when there is no screenguard/tempered glass applied on display. Watching movies is very enjoyable everytime.
8. Top Notch Speed Flagship Killer comes with 8GB RAM with 256GB of Storage is enough for all heavy files and games. It supports dual nano SIM with dual standby 4G+4G which is quite good and lovable.
9. When it comes to operating system and processor it comes with Android Oreo 8.1 Oxygen with Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 Octa Core Processor which is highest available in market at this price.
10. Its face unlock features works very well when compared to iPhone X. Fingerprint sensor works fine, Water Resistant feature haven't checked as it is costly so I always avoid water from the device after even its water resistant.
11. User Interface can be improved a lil bit more for steady use to everyone and earphones can be their inside the box at this price range and a brand should manage to provide maximum accessories along with its Flagship phone atleast.
12. Overall performance is good as device works very well on all stages of usage where as while using it continuosly along with its all components at extreme levels. And its stability over the android is mindblowing.
13. Finally, I would recommend everyone to buy this device who is looking for a phone at this price range. No such phone is available in market with such high end configurations at this price range.",4
"Today . i got it from amazon. This is really nice  mobile.Nice delivery by amazon. i ordered it on 11 oct ant i got this product on 13 oct in the morning.when i unboxed the box it was not damaged at all..every thing was perfec

"Well really it stands by its theme of never settle down perfect mobile for the cost. You will fall in love with it once u hold this beauty. Great in pitchure quality, batter life and sound quality pretty good",5
"The phone is just perfect for every type of use, whether it be office/professional use for reading/editing heavy docs or spreadsheets, or it be full mutimedia use for photography or blogging, it works smooth with good reasonable battery performance.
And for gaming, this phone play everything in max settings, played PUBG in HDR in Max frame rate ~40fps.

Build quality is excellent and rigid..
Best part is its camera... It is top class..",5
"Brought on very first day of Amazon great Indian sale for prime users and Phone is found defective after 1 day of usage. Just wondering, How can production miss the basic tests before it goes out.
1)Sim card slots are having issues. Android os background process consuming data of sim 2 however sim1 is set for mobile data uses. This is resulting into multiple pop ups from network provider and battery drainage
2) battery not lasting for whole day in normal usage
3) Google search not working. Nothing happens on click of Google search widget
4) some apps not responding at all on click of icon. Quite strange is, sometimes Amazon app doesn't open at all which is exclusive place to buy this phone
5) you can't turn off WiFi .it automatically turns back on
Now I need to wait for replacement as model is out of stock. I can't place new order as purchase is limited to one per account and SBI discount won't be applicable till return is completed.",1
Everything,5

"Excellent performance. The phone is butter smooth. Apps open very fast and despite opening multiple apps,there is no lag. Camera does very good job in low light. Games are very smooth and it's a pleasure to use the mobile. The UI is also very simple and smooth. No unnecessary bloatware. Only thing I that could have been better is the speakers and output sound. Phone charges from 0-100% in roughly 1 hour which is impressive. Battery life is okay. Lasts a day on moderate usage. OnePlus 6 is a hit. Must buy !!",5
Have received my Oneplus 6 today and facing battery charging problem. It stuck at 50%. While charging it shows battery low and device temperature is low.,1

"Was using One plus 3 for the last 2 years and was totally satisfied. Was looking forward for a special deal on Oneplus 6 this festival season. Finally got a great deal. After all the discounts and exchange deal, got OP6 for RS 28000/ flat. Now that's a special price for a special phone, no?
Of course, you have already gone through the pros and cons of this device. Let me tell you, for this price, the hardcore Apple fans are already looking for a switch over.
Great phone and great deal!!!
And thanks Amazon for delivering inside 48 hours.",5
Phenomenal,5
"Picture quality superb.
Pubg player should go for this for sure.
Battery goes quickly down and charges also quickly up so the battery is okay not too good not too bad.

The mobile product is awesome!!? Satisfied more than expectation and only thing the mobile back cover was very dirt like old one with full of dirt in it !!!! Amazon have to maintain the quality for big products too and unsatisfied in packing ...very cheap packing,4
"It is a beast. And I got this at 27k + added benefits and bonuses in the Great Indian Sale. Thankn you, Amazon, for that and for impeccable delivery of the product.
Now coming to the phone,
Camera is incredible. Great details and colours are brought out. It's crisp and at the same time not very sharp.
Notch : Seriously, I don't get why it should be a concern. I have hardly noticed it all the while. Plus, you can hide it if you want to. I have been using it without hiding.
Fingerprint : Placed at a slightly uncomfortable position. But it's ultra fast. Face unlock is also very rapid.
Speakers perform the job that they were assigned with. Got no problems, and no specialities.
Led notification is awesome. You can customize it's color.
Gesture based actions is very useful, like for pausing a song, or to open flashlight.
Overall, the phone is just pure awesome. It's nothing less than a majestic beast.",5
Good Product and on-spot delivery !! Good Job,5
"Everything is perfect except for the way One plus 6 reserves the space for the storage. After Android Pie upgrade, about 9 gb of storage occupied to store OS data. Later further app installation and update consumed 5 gb more. So I'm left with only 50 gb of effective data. Future android updates would even reduce more space, so serious space issue arises in this 64 gb version of this phone. I'd request One plus to see if this issue could be resolved in future updates by optimizing the system space reserve.",3
"Honestly,this is my third OnePlus phone. And it's awesome.
After 1 week of uses, the best anroid phone I have ever used.",5
Pls help with this I buy 1+ 6 midnight Black 8gb ram 128gb ROM I the package I opened that time bill is stick to the parcel and all ready damaged how can I get future warranty,4

Main highlight is its OXYGEN OS which is totally customised for amazing performance.",5
The best phone u can get currently at this price. Sold iPhone to buy this and do not regret it.,5
"Guys. This is the product to go for. At this price of festival season discount Rs. 27,000, this is the device to go for. I know, 6t is coming, but with no major upgrades. Go for this device and look for 5G device with upgraded features next year.",5
It's the best phone I ever get,5
Best phone,5
"product is good,best ui based android Pie,fast charging very speed,good mobile,but price litiile bit high it's not flagship mobile but price flagship range ,no ip cirtified and no wireless charging,main thing is .no  earphones provided",4
Awesome ....,5
As expected by OnePlus...,5
Got it for a total of 25k. Pretty dope deal!!,5
Now this is the phone you should buy if you are looking for the speed> battery life> design> camera> reliability. In short best phone till date. Nothing more you can get in same price range. Screw iphone,5
"Before this I have used Oneplus3 for 3 years..and Oneplus has never disappointed me for even one day...
New purchase Oneplus 6 is amazing.. Simply superb...I opted Oneplus 6 over 6T because I didnt find much changes in 6T n to pay another huge amount for it.. I exchanged it for my Oneplus3 n by putting additional SBI offer during Great Indian Sale, I got this phone in 20799 üòÄüòÄüòÄ
Sound : clarity is perfect..over call n music too
Camera: Exceptional..loved it..
Battery : its usp of Oneplus..always amazing.
Look n feel : Sleek n sexy
Overall : a must buy",5
Superb product only problem is battery but it charges super quick with dash charger so it's a worth of money,5
Amazing smartphone at this price range super fast charging and a very stunning camera go for it and even face lock is so quick and i have shared a picture taken from my one plus so you will kno what kind of picture quality one plus gives,5
Just greatü§©,5
One plus 6 is just awesome with an pie updated version with awesome features and picture quality,5
"This Phone sucks. Moto  G5 was better than this. Poor camera quality. Babba processor. The phone is bending. UI is not user-friendly. This phone cannot even handle apps like Facebook and Snapchat. Hangs when I open small games. Taking 4 hours to full charge and 3 hours to discharge. Poor signal reception. Poor face unlocks even opens for my photograph. HeadPhone jack sucks cannot understand music.
I expected more from one plus.",1
Utterly disappointed because of drop in price of the product by 5000 - just after few days of my purchase.,4
"Got this beast (128GB version) for 29k during the sale. I could have waited for 6T but didn't want to sacrifice my new headphones. Though I don't regret my decision. Flagship specs at such a price is a treat.
OS: Oxygen OS is buttery smooth. No bloatware s. Can't believe I missed such an experience all this time. Ample of RAM to provide you a lag-free experience.
Battery lasts through a day easily with heavy internet usage and moderate gaming.
Dash charging is the real deal. Goes from 0-30 in just 10mins.
Camera is brilliant. Not the best but you can take some stunning photos with proper settings in place.
Speakers are loud and clear. You won't face any problem with it.
Overall I am satisfied that I stuck to my decision for OP6.
Go for it !!! It won't disappoint.",5
"Additional features made phone slow. If we are on WhatsApp call, phone gets hot and battery drainage occurs. Camera is good however close shots do not come clear. Speaker needs a little improvement otherwise it is ok, when I say improvement it means it is not that loud. Battery charging is good but if u use WhatsApp it goes down very quickly.  Phone is getting hot when u play games for more than 20 minutes and again battery drainage occurs.
Overall I don't see any improvement in the phone just coping function from other phone's and adding more apps made it sick. Not a good choice if u r gamer or Whatsapp addict.",1
I don't have any words to say.....it's simply mind blowing...I loved it...,5
"Great phone at great price. Only drawback is the external speaker sound is lesser compared to one plus5 i assume it is coz this phone is waterproof!!!
Amazing battery backup..Great display and camera too.",5
"Without wasting time
Pros
Snapdragon 845
Nearly stock android
2 years software updates +1 year security updates
Amoled display
Good picture quality
Good built quality
NFC eith tap and pay
Dual 4G
Cons
Display mode which is default looks oversaturated
No sd card (for hardcore users)
A bit of warmth if played games
Bad memory optimisation
Camera is average
The screen turns low brightness even while watching it",4
Super fast phone..gaming experience is awesome.no lag at all.,5
The best Android you can get in the market.,4
nice,5
"After using 2 days i feel great no hanging great camera quality dash charging is also work great. PUBG game is also running without any problem. Amazon delivery is very fast i received my phone next day.
camera quality is very awesome.",5
"Pros:
Snapdragon 845 + Oxygen OS + Android Pie stable version = Lightning speed performance.
Face and fingerprint unlock are very fast.
Stunning design and looks.
Camera more than satisfactory for my requirements.
Cons:
Having used Lenovo K4 Note previously, which had stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos audio enhancement, OnePlus 6 seems a bit downgrade in that respect.
Overall:
With amazon, SBI and exchange offers, I got the 8 GB/128 GB model for under 30k.  Don't think I could do any better with that budget than this beast.",5
"Nice and sturdy, only disappointment being the price drop. Purchased on 9sep in 35K exact one month and it is available for 27K.",5
Nice features,5
"Classy phone and a best camera , Worth the money.",5
"Considering the price point(33k 10oct218 festive sale) its a total value for money.
The only downside is battery backup, i harldy get 3-4 hrs of sot in normal usage though this can be fixed with software updates.",4
Perfect Andorid Phone.,5
Good Phone,5
All round performance by one plus,5
I have received a defective phone...rear camera isn't working properly ....I cannot click a single picture all the photos are coming blur from rear camera .very poor ..wasn't expecting this from Amazon and also 1+...,2
"Good Phone as am USING since once plus 2  and  now  Using  One Plus 6 ,
Next target for 5G  Phone .",4
"The main advantage is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845.
very hand to use.
The display is good and photos quality is also good.
It serves my purpose",5
The device is fine but the bill i received is of no use as i got only the second half of it that too with printing issues,3
Nice phone .. I am loving it.. so fast and accurate,5
Good in all terms.,5
Always the best...,5
"I was little sceptical before buying this phone but this phone is just awesome. For rs35000 I got 8GB ram and 128gb memory. This phone is worth every penny. Camera is awesome. Not the iPhone camera quality but best among the budget phone available in market, speed is good. Love the face unlock.its really fast.the only problem m facing with this phone is that it  leaves fingerprint smudges on back over and front screen maybe it won't be a issue with the other versions available",5
"Faster, easy to use, face recognition and unlocking is super fast, touch accuracy can‚Äôt compare with apple(only place one plus goes low)",4
"Ok, OnePlus surely knows how to turn heads. pic quality is amazing but there are a few tiny things that prevented me from giving a full star rating.
1. Face unlock happens only after pressing a button.This should not be the case.
2. Real colours aren't displayed, the camera is auto tuned to give the high contrast. While this maybe good for a certain set of users.I didn't like it that much.
3. Speaker sound seems too loud and overall they can work a little more on fine tuning the sound. Its ok when you put in headphones though.
Rest everything, Loved It! Got it in Amazon sale so that was great too.",4
Cool,5
Just a perfect phone,5
"After deciding among many android phones, i decided to buy One Plus 6 and it was a good decision. Phone has a crisp display and comes with lot of processing power. Loved the front camera, takes sharp pictures. Rear camera is also great however pictures may get blurry when subject is in slight motion. Looking for a good camera app that can help fix this.
Overall a great phone at this price point.",4
Night camera,4
Wow ....really satisfied with this.,5
"In my opinion this One plus 6 The Best I used so far , regarding camera super I must said video quality is excellent, battery is good, performance excellent, sounds not bad but couldn't compare to the iPhone sound quality I must said because I have use iPhone se and the sound recording is so good , otherwise I love this phone 1+6 it is recommended to everyone.
Go for it guys.",5
"really awesome one,jus go for it.",5
Superb,5
"No doubt a super smart phone, with amazing price from Amazon the Great Indian sale.
The dash charging makes my phone charge 0-100 in nearly 70 mins
Camera is the best
Unlocks in a flash
Soft case is decent
SD 845 superfast processor
Overall 10/10",5
Mobile is ok. When will we get 1000 Amazon pay balance?,5
"One Plus 6 is an excellent phone for the price. The look and feel of the phone is very rich.
Processor is really fast. No hanging and heating issues. Battery life with normal usage is about 2 Days as of now (without gaming). Camera is also very good. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock are lighting fast. So is the charging with the Type C Dash Charger. It has also got the Android Pie update recently.
The only negative point is no earphones in the box.",5
The beast arrived my home in style. Dream come true for me. Nothing can beat the performance of this device One Plus 6 thanks to Amazon for such great deal in this Great Indian Sale.,4
Camera is unbelievably good in all light conditions. Video stability is magnificent. Best battery back up. Very user friendly.,4

"This phone is nailed it,I am hardcore I phone user but this OnePlus 6 is just speechless the design, inbuilt quality!one word for the OnePlus 6is fireüî• worth buying in this 33k budget,I am very glad I just booked yesterday evening and got by early morning today!Amzaon services is like rocket speed!but one thing is need to mention for Amazon""the outer packing of this product is very bad quality, please tell your service partner to increase the packaging quality!",5
Fantabulous.,5
"I received my phone today(12/10/2018) on sale.
After receiving the phone everything seems quite good from outside so  I ran some test through OnePlus care app  then my test for speaker failed,I got scared as I just received a brand new phone,for once I thought may be it's refurbished phone they send me after all it's sales days.
Then I looking up for solution at internet and found some creepy solution like restart,boot the device but all in vain,then after all this I clear the cache memory and factory reset my phone after doing that it finally works.
Still doubting the originality of phone(fresh or refurbished?)",3
This phone has no flaws . This is one of the most superior phone of the OnePlus 2018 .,4
This is my third OnePlus phone and I have never been less satisfied with the performance. Absolutely love it!,5
"Its my first device in flagship segment. Feels very premium, great display, great camera. Supper fast",5

Good product,4
"Well being a Samsung S6 edge user for 3 years I was sceptical about the brand initially . But once i got the mobile in hand I knew one thing for sure , this mobile is a beast , the display is pretty good ofcourse not good as Samsung , the camera is pretty good for the price , ofcourse it cant match Google's Pixel or the S9
But where this phone blows everyone away is in its performance , ots sinply the fastest android out there . And the Dash Charging is amazing fast.
Only grouse is the kinda meh Battery life
But overall an amazing phone",4
Amazon is selling the defective phone in this sale. The slow motion camera is very bad and dark like a VGA CAMERA. please don't buy 64GB version.,1
Nice phone,5

"Superb picture quility
Decent sound
Best battery life",4
"I moved from redmi note 3 to this phone while thinking I might miss so many features of miui but to my surprise, the oxygen is has almost all the miui features in a more elegant way. Used it for 2 days,I am not a heavy user so easily got 1 day battery life( camera sucks lot of battery though).camera is very good in this price range(front camera is ok ok and edge detection inportrait mode is not perfectly done).Audio experience is not the best but it was louder than my previous phone.Dash charging with type c cable is insanely fast. Already got the Android p update. Call quality is very good. The display is unbelievably good(AMOLED display, gorilla glass 5 on front and back), especially for a budget phone user like me.There are many gestures related to navigation buttons, there is ambient display feature (lift to wake), screen can be calibrated to default/sRGB/DCI-P3/Adaptive mode/ custom color(warm and cool slider), supports double tap to lock and wake up, gestures to open apps, supports parallel apps, 2 4g Sims can be used simultaneously,there is nfc, gaming mode, reading mode, night mode, face unlock, finger print scanner( both can be used simultaneously and both are extremely fast) notch can be hidden, there is customisable LED notification,app lock, otg support, FM radio, sound recorder, no default music player, 3.5mm headphone jack :-), no bloatwares except for 1 OnePlus community app and Google apps, not a big fan of gaming, so haven't tried that....and the list goes on. And of course timely android updates.",4
Best than Samsung and apple,5
"Picked the 6+64 from amazon great indian sale @ 27k ! What a beast of a phone ! Literally sooo fast and stunning üòç. Top build , top display, top battery life , oxygen os is smoothest with pie . Just loving it.",5

"I was waiting for OnePlus 6t about 1 month but I decided to purchase oneplus 6 over OnePlus 6t because there will be no major changes like waterdrop notch , indisplay fingerprint sensor, improved camera, improved battery but this will be no improvement because of increase in display .
I got it for 33000 + Amazon pay 1000+ free screen replacement for 1 year but I doesn't receive any msg yet.
OnePlus 6t may be more expensive by 1000-3000
and there will be no headphone jack.
Best tym to buy OnePlus 6.

Battery consumption is too good. And all over performance is superb,5
"i got a defect piece, and it will be restarting again and again its over 1hour restarting.",1
One word Awesome.,5
This phone is a beast. It proves what they claim ‚ÄúThe Speed You Need‚Äù. Could‚Äôve have given a higher resolution display. The one given does the job very well though.,5
Amazing screen and great build,5
Camera quality has definitely improved! Oxygen OS is smooth and fun to use. One cannot be dissatisfied with this premium phone. Purchased it because OP6T will have no headphone jack which will compromise the sound quality. Go for this phone!,5
It's awesome,5
I purchased this phone on 25july and today is 11 Oct...it been less than 3 months and my screen have a dead cell in the lower right corner...even it didn't drop or didn't come in contact of water or any pressure on phone......very poor protection of screen.,1
This phone is amazing. Camera quality is good. Sound quality also loud and clear and performance  as they say. The speed you need. It's a beast in this range.,5
Excellent,5
Camera totally blur,1
I like all the features on that product. But the problem is i dont like the curve shape of this phone n camera position of this phine. If the shape n camera position is of any other phone like iphone x it would be very perfect undescribable....,5
Master Piece for the Price Tag,5
Overall an amazing experience! Perfect phone to switch from iOS üòÄ,5
"This one's a beast. I wasnt an android user until i got my hands on this and it changed the game. Not saying that its the best one out there but you get a winner for the price. 4k videos shot on it can give professional cameras a run for their money. Camera is awesome, battery backup is decent as im a heavy user so i need to juice it up twice a day. OS is blazingly fast and very smooth. From outside, the phone gives a premium feel. Dash charger spoils you as u wouldnt want to charge ur device with any other charger. My only regret now is that i should have gone for a 256 GB variant.",5
Best phone in market.,5
Nice,4
I like the product picture sound battery qualities are good,5

Very good,5
"I purchased this phone three months ago and this is a review after three months of usage ...
The battery is pretty good and the charging is even better ... Just 30 mins of charging will give you a battery life of 60-70 percent ... This feature of Dash Charging has revolutionized the charging of mobiles ... No need to keep it on charging for whole night as required for earlier mobiles ...
The camera is just awesome ... The pictures in both day and night are very very crisp and clear. .. the selfie is also very good ...
The Mirror black has a very shiny back cover with a mirror finish and feels very good in the hand ...
While playing games like asphalt, the phone is very very fast with no lag and the graphics are also very good
Overall a must buy phone if you are looking for a complete package of Good camera, Good Display , speed , Battery back up .",5
Excellent,5

Finally get the phone...smooth as ####,5
value for money,5
"First and foremost Amazon's prime delivery experience is amazing.  I ordered the mobile on Oct 9th at 12:30 and got delivered the next day around 10:30; this despite me residing in a remote location.  So thumbs up Amazon you have a wide reach and you score high over your immediate competitor on this aspect.  Now a brief review of the product.  I'm not a technical man, just putting it in simple layman's language here.  The device per se looks uber cool with gorgeous glossy finish.  Face unlock feature is pretty quick, it unlocks in milliseconds great work.  I've read some negative reviews regarding fingerprint unlocking feature.  I think if there's any dirt in your finger it doesn't recognize quickly else it works good.  The dash charger is one of its kind, it takes 75 mins to charge from 0 to 100%, and should easily last 24 hours.  Software security update is released recently dated September 5, 2018, better update that once you start using the device.  I did use the quick gesture feature for answering calls, but it's not up to the mark, it lags at times.  In sum, the device performance is great, any task is a smooth sailing.  Camera looks good and satisfactory.",4
It's fantastic,5
Overall good,5
Charging fastly but Battery backup is average only..,3
ANOTHER BEAST FROM ONE PLUS WITH AWESOME ALL ROUND PEEFORMANCE & THANKS TO AMAZON- GREAT INDIAN SALE!!!,5
Phone speed nd quality beter more tan other phone....,3

Got defective product. Portrait mode is not working.,1
Awesome is all that I can say....,5
Excellent product,5
"I have owned various premium brands of phones over the years like Samsung, Motorola. I guess this is one of the best phones you could buy today. It's extremely zippy & handles any application with ease. I'm not a person who uses the phone extensively - in this scenario, I consistently get a battery life of more than 3 days! One of the other great aspects is that updates are frequent & I was already on Android Pie few weeks ago - this is just a distant dream in other brands which I have owned. Sound could have been a little better, but it is more than acceptable. Screen display is also excellent. Overall, highly recommended.",5
The phone is excellect in the cost that it is available for. The camera has a special blurring option and selfie quality is superb,4
"Smooth,fast and hassle free. Only some issues with the new update. Rest works great ,bang for the bucks!",4
"Sound , picture quality is as expectedly very good, the best thing I like about one plus is processing speed, it's really too fast, and Amazon delivery is fast too just got the item within 15hrs.",5
It was unbelivable,5
This is the best affordable flagship. Rear camera is great. Formerly front camera is not getting good quality images but after update it getting much better. 845 processor is rocking. Played pubg on high quality but doesnt notice any heat. Sound quality is also good with headphones.,5
One of the best flagship I ever had.,5
"Amazed with sceen unlocks. Sometimes you do not even see the lock screens.
Super fast.
2 days update - I must say that the audio quality of the device (for music) is below average. It's not even average. Connected even Sony's hi res 13k headphones and tested.
Needs a lot improvement for audio.
Reducing one more star",3
"To be frank, one plus got worst service ever",1
Battery life of the product delivered is poor. It has drained more than 30% in 3 hrs . Phone gets heated up while talking . This is the first day of usage. Definitely not expected of One Plus,1
Best.,5

Amazing beast.... Wonderful in look and very fasttt in performance.,5

SOMETIMES M NOT ABLE TO SET WALLPAPERS.

After updating some bugs are there expect that its amazing phone,5
"After using 5 month's no single problem i have seen.
This product is value for money",5
Better to upgrade battery backup to 4000mah,5
"If you have 30k and are looking for a good phone, go for OnePlus 6, this is the best phone you can get right now with all the required features and utilities.. OnePlus also has a good record for after sales service. I already own a OnePlus 3, which i have been using for 2 years without any problem... And now OnePlus 6... The mirror black finish gives it a royal look.",5

Totally a beast.,5
"Best phone in this price üòç, im really glad that i ordered this phone, very fast and smooth with high end performance, Oneplus really made THE SPEED YOU NEED",5
"1. Battery life is somewhat not that great bcoz of the small 3300mah packed (A XIAOMI 10k device gives us a great a battery life, ie 4000mah).
2. Use of secondary camera is really limited.. I think it could be extended by oneplus.
3. No wireless charging, no IP rating & no stereo speakers.
4. In MI 10k budget devices we have a unique feature which i really like, that is IR blaster, i think these small features could have been implemented in it which really makes a device stand out.
5. There is no 4k display present.
DO NOTE ONEPLUS : Most of the samsung users do not switch from samsung to Oneplus because of the samsung's 4k display.
I seriously feel if u think about these changes no one could have thought of buying any other smartphone in the market.
Apart from OXYGEN_OS or the SPEED u give us in your devices, are the only things people are going for. But sadly these are also given by xiaomi in poco series and in less price (although it gives miui but in terms of speed, processor, etc it is all same). So your mobiles does not stand out anywhere uniquely as of now.
Overall, yes its a great device, i love it but this is all what i feel.",4
Ultimate flagship killer. Pure and extreme speed and got Android Pie update as well. Great product.,5
Supb mobile....there are no words to explain,5
Nice products,5
Worth price.. nice product !,5
"Pure Android and Oxygen Os making this device fantastic with great picture quality,good battery life, and decent speaker..üôÇ",4
Dash charging is awesome. Charges full battery in just 40 minutes. 8 GB RAM is amazing,5
Looks very good (rich look). Easy functions. Battery needs to improve. Handling is easy. Came in really good condition. All told asecceries were there in box. Picture quality needs improvement and not many innovative functions in camera... It's 116 GB rom instead of 128 gb.,5
Noise in camera pics.,5
Best phone. I have bought 2,5
Picture quality could be better. The images become blur after taking photos and many users are facing this issue.,5

Using warranty card nothing we can't do for changing the old version OS  using  warranty card it's free but service charge is 1000 rupee then whats use of the warranty card it's waste totally waste I got very hurted due to this incident
There is nothing for this mobile totally waste product
If any damage occur there is no replacement in Amazon so Amazon is also cheating",1

"As everyone knows it's a flagship killer. So no need to say anything about this one.. But still gotta have to give my review üòã .
P.S:- I'm giving this review after using it for 3 n 1/2 months.
1. Build quality awesome. Specially glass finishing gives a elegant look.
2. Display AMOLED. The best you get. N notch üòç
3. Camera is awesome. After Android Pie update the HDR mode is not there. Overally one of the best compared to S9+, iPhone 7+ etc.
4. What can I say about Processor, the name is enough SNAPDRAGON 845 üòé.
5. Dual 4G stand by. Better for people like me who use Jio n Airtel. It's very helpful in some areas where Jio is not so fast switching to Airtel 4G will help.
6. Battery life is good but If you are Mi user then you will be bit disappointed üòÅ. You can use the phone for nearly 24 hrs. By switching on data, playing games, social sites browsing..",5
Love it and it's slim design awesome color,5
Just one word for this phone - "Awesome",5
"One plus you should improve your camera quality. By the way phone speed, performance is excellent...",5

"I've been a OnePlus fan for a few years now - I had the OnePlus 3, 5, and now, 6. I've been happy with both of my previous devices but this one has had a malfunctioning fingerprint sensor. I tried to get Amazon to give me a replacement within the first ten days but the tech support rep tried to discourage that and instead offered home visit and such. Interestingly, the Blancco diagnostics app wouldn't even launch, it kept crashing repeatedly. The fingerprint sensor doesn't always register and wake the device. Besides that, there's the classic Oxygen OS issue of large battery drain that shows up as Google Play Services or Android OS. Now that I'm forced to use the faulty device without replacement, I think I'll have to try some custom ROMs and hope that they resolve some of the issues, the battery drain at least.",1
Amazing phone,5

"No doubt it is a good phone as it has best processor, ram and latest Android ( now 9) too. But if u have used or using a Samsung flagship devices as I used S7 edge and next s8 plus then this OnePlus 6 can't never satisfy you in term of user experience which is of very premium level when u use Samsung flagship devices. After selling my s8 plus I bought this OnePlus 6 on 9 Aug and within 3 months this phone is unable to keep me interested using anymore. Afterall it is oppo vivo brother. The software experience and UI are of same cheep Chinese quality. Marketing of this phone was done in such a was that it has almost same camera quality as s8 plus. But trust me it is no where near the Samsung S7 edge and s8 plus camera. Though it says it has Amoled display but the quality of display is like other Full hd + mobiles. After using super Amoled quad HD curved display of Samsung flagship which gives a treat to ur eyes with its immersive feel the OnePlus 6 display will give u disappointment only. By investing 35 thousands u may say to ur self that u got a flagship processor ram latest Android in half of the price of Samsung flagship device which I also made myself understood while purchasing this device. But when it comes to real life usage. It give u an experience and feeling of a cheep Chinese Mobile of rs 15 to 20 thousand. I made a mistake. Don't u make a mistake by buying OnePlus 6 or 6T.",3

"Premium smart phone experience, with a higher midrange price. 8 gb RAM, Very good camera quality. Oxygen OS is very much fluid. Near about stock android experience, with little bit extra functionalities. Superior SD845 chip provides butter Smoot mobile experience. Responsive face ID, though it doesn't works in dark environment. It's touch response little bit slow. It has single audio speker. No wireless charging. Though the back of the phone made of glass. Screen quality is  very good. Overall an very good product with a decent price point.",5

"There is a serious software issue. Google play and Google search is not working. Other apps are also misbehaving. I went to service centre. Waited for my turn for an hour. They reinstalled the software.... After that Google play worked for around an hour but again stopped. I am unable to activate hotspot and can't able to download any app. The basic functionalities are not working. I regret deeply why I bought this phone. There are only 7-8 service centers across India. I went to Nehru place Delhi service centre where there was only one girl and one service engineer to support but 13-15 people were waiting for their turn. It was a very pathetic experience. Due to too much of work load that girl was not even paying heed towards customer's problems. By the way it was not her fault since she was overloaded. I spent 35,000 for this phone but this is of no use for me now. I suggest not to burn your money on this phone. They are just spending huge money to create false positivity around the brand and phones. Also paying great incentives to Amazon for promoting their products.",1

It works great and is very snappy due to its animation but after a week of usage a slight problem was developed in the vibration motor which inspite of being in warranty was not repaired by the service center. Aside from this I do get an above average battery life which lasts full day with moderate usage whereas with heavy usage the device has to be charged for the second time in the evening. Camera is not exceptional but it‚Äôs good for the price.,4

One plus 6 is a very good and fast phone. Their os is kept light not like samsung which does heavy cutomization on top of stock android and make the phone sluggish.

"After using 3 months am writing this. Phone works perfectly fine and doesn't have any issue. Reason behind giving 1 star and blaming both OnePlus and Amazon is that from 10-15 October phone is available with almost 15% discount and free screen protection, which I don't think is perviously seen for OnePlus phones. It would have been better that I should have waited and used my old phone which was having no issue. Hope someone from Amazon or OnePlus would revert and make justice to customer who had bought with full payment without discount.",1

"Everything is flawless for this phone. The price to performance king. Flagship killer. An epitome of smartphone for companies like Apple. Never seen any faster app switching in any other smartphone. It's snappy and blazingly fast. Just one con that the speaker on this device is not good, kind of below average.",5
"processor is very good
speaker is not as good
video and audio recording quality is not good
cameras are normal
battery life is very good
looks are too good
amoled screen is also good
face unlock and fingerprint sensors are too fast",3

"Actually I was using my second Apple 6s 32gb model, but I thought it better to switch to this new brand One Plus 6 which has been able to sway over the tide of Apple. This mobile handset is definitely giving good service to me, it is 8gb RAM and 128gb storage is not having any parrallel competition in the market. Very excellent product in the mobile handset market. It's dash charger works very well in charging the battery to full in just 40 minutes.",5
Powerful Android mobile,5
Sound not good and night picture very bad quality.,3
"I bought this phone at 35K thinking this is the best phone in the world, but I was so wrong! After few days I noticed that every video recorded from this phone has a very loud noise, something like ""hissssss"". I searched net and found that this is related to very high sensitivity of one plus phone mic, and it is a general problem with one plus phones. This is absolutely pathetic for such high end phone!!! Even a 10k phone is far better because you would not want to waste precious recordings of your best moments just because of a pathetic sound issue. Please avoid this phone!!! Also, I am trying to contact amazon, but cant find a simple way to contact them!! This is ridiculous, once a package is delivered, they make contacting them so hard!!",1
Fine products,3
"Happy to have a product like this.
Overall quality of the product is very good.

The phone heats while charging,4
"I purchased this phone and thought it was a decent buy until I walked into a OnePlus store for support. I put on a Spigen cover for the phone and have never dropped it. One fine day I open to clean it and to my surprise, the rear glass is broken. I'm shocked and I'm left wondering how this happened. So I contact OnePlus, book an appointment and walk in to a OnePlus store in Hyderabad. So the guy tells me, I'm sorry Sir, but this model is prone to damage there's nothing we can do. I said the phone is 3 months old, how can you NOT be showing me any form of customer care at all? He says it's an accidental damage and warranty will not cover it. I walk out telling him, yes it is damage, but there was no accident, just poorly build quality. And oh, the camera image quality is nothing compared to a Pixel or an iPhone X. Pathetic portrait mode too. Just blurs everything around the subject, like that's supposed to make it look dramatic.  Very disappointed.",1
It's perfect for college students as well as for business purpose,5
"Dad needed a new phone, dual SIM was a must and I was inclined on getting him something he could use for a while without dealing with lag and outdated software. I just browsed on Amazon looking for offers on the One Plus 6 and there was an exchange offer where my old One Plus 2 was being offered ‚Çπ9,500 and a cashback for HDFC Credit Card. Took the leap and bought the phone. A brilliant deal.
Coming to the phone itself,
Display is gorgeous. Nowhere close to a qHD but more than adequate for an enjoyable experience.
Audio from the speaker is just ok at best.
Camera is decent and takes really good pictures at times but nothing to talk about.
Call Quality is really good.
Battery Life is really good and the bundled dash charger makes it even better.",5
Awesome,5
Outstanding mobile with this budget.,5
"It has the best camera with an amazing battery life added with a nitro charger which charges your phone completely within 25-30 mins. Haven't checked a lot on the sound quality but surely not as good as an I phone. But I phone 7 plus 128 Gb will be this phone's right substitute which is Rs. 70,000. So this phone is more than worth it's money. You can close your eyes and go for it.",5
"Nothing to dislike. Everything is awesome, speed, camera, looks, value for money. Fast charging is really very fast.",5
"Absolutely love it. Superb specs in this price. Though the design maybe simple and sometimes boring the features is the rocking part of it. Super fast. Doesn't lag. Love the notch and the quick charge is my favourite part about this phone. Hands-down one of the. Eat phones I have used, ever. Absolutely loving this phone. Fully satisfied.",5

"Writing this review after 1.5 months of usage.
One Plus 6 is an excellent phone for the price. The look and feel of the phone is very rich.
Processor is really fast. No hanging and heating issues. Battery life with normal usage is about 2 Days as of now (without gaming). Camera is also very good. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock are lighting fast. So is the charging with the Type C Dash Charger. It has also got the Android Pie update recently.
The only negative point is no earphones in the box. I expect to get earphones when I am paying 35000 for a phone.",5
Everything is good and perfect but some improvement in battery life makes it even more perfect.,5

The dash charge in real usage beyond expectations, damn fast. And I recently updated to Officiall Android 9 Pie sent by One Plus through OTA update. Very happy to get one my favourite Red colour.

"OMG, this is the best phone i have in my while life. This is the first time in using a one plus product and I must say this is a good value for money. Most of the people go behind the iPhone x which I think is really over priced. OP6 is faster than iPhone and it had been ptoven. The best part is that it is not even half the price of the iPhone x. The camera is also really good, although not as good as the pixel or the iPhone, it captures details very well. before this, I had an iPhone 5s and I'm a big fan of pubg but I couldn't enjoy myself with such a small screen. But OP6 even has a gaming mode along with a bigger screen which is really helpful for me. Go for it!",5

"Earlier, I was using a Samsung Galaxy J7 with 1.5 GB ram. To install and use a new app, one app needed to be deleted.
I have heard a lot about One Plus mobiles and decided to give it a shot. Glad I made the choice.
Things you get along with device is Dash Charger, screen-guard on the screen and a plastic cover.
The look and feel of the device are amazing. Midnight black comes with a classy matte finish. It is somewhat slippery to handle. The plastic cover is good for protection but if you don't like it you might need to spend 1-2k extra for a cover. I bought a sandstone cover for 1k and it looks good.
The one feature which sets this phone apart is the Dash Charger: 20 minutes is all it needs to get it charged for 30-40% and for about 30 minutes it will get to 60-75% which is more than enough.
Camera quality of this phone is comparable but not better than iPhone or other devices which costs at least 20k more than this. An image clicked by an experienced photographer from OnePlus can still beat a novice to intermediate photographer's iPhone pictures.
One another Feature you get is Face Unlock which is extremely fast and you will get addicted to it. It will be difficult to use other phones which cost lower than this because you will not want to slide or enter the pin or use the fingerprint scanner to unlock the device.
You will use anything and everything for this phone instead of your laptop or tablet.
I even booked a tatkal ticket on irctc while traveling in Bangalore traffic at 10:00 am!
If you are willing to spend 35-45k on a mobile which is not going to be obsolete in at least 2 years. You should opt for this model.
Some dilemma which people face:
6GB vs 8GB
Personally, I think 8GB should be preferable not for gaming but. We can't be sure whether 6 GB would be sufficient RAM after 2 years of time. I don't play mobile games but bought 8GB model just because 6GB might be normal after 2 years.
Space: 64GB vs 128GB vs 256GB
Provided that this model does not have an sd card slot, you will be stuck with whatever model you choose.
64GB is way too low for this phone because of a single recording or some pictures might take a couple of GB. Also, you get 52GB usable space which might not be sufficient. Hence you should either go with 128 or 256 variant.
128 is the most optimal choice and one should go for 256 only if following is the case:
1) You take a lot of pictures and videos, travel a lot, and don't believe in storing those in the cloud.
2) You watch tv shows and movies downloaded on your laptop and watch it on mobile.
Example:- My brother has a 64 GB variant of Samsung mobile, 2 complete courses from coursera and a couple of videos, photos that he clicked used 48-50 GB of storage space. (85-90% of available)
Amount:- 2 complete courses 200 video lectures and family video recording short clips
Whereas in my 256 GB model even if I have entire One Piece of 800 episodes i.e. 90-120GB it will still be around 50% of storage space.
You can spend extra 5-10k on storage once, but no matter what you do you can't expand the memory to 128 or 256 after you made the purchase. Hence I would recommend deciding accordingly which suits your requirement.
The only negative point is they could have included earphones with this but sadly they have not.
Overall:- I was satisfied with the purchase I made from Amazon Prime(which gave me the subscription to one-two day delivery in metro cities and Amazon video content)",5
"Product is good but facing too much issue in incoming calls. Earlier no issue but after 2-3 months, facing issue with incoming calls. 2 out of 10 calls are successful.",4

Never Settle , True üëå
The phone is killing it.
True Deal üëå",5
"One of the best phone in today's time in this price range. The flagship phone of Oneplus, OnePlus 6 comes with a dash charger which is fastest charging technology. The camera is great and you can record videos in 1080p 4k videos with 60 fps. Selfie camera has also been improved slightly and comes with the beauty mode. There is face unlock which is really fast and doesn't take even a second to recognise your face. Fingerprint sensor is below the camera which is uncomfortable at starting but you will get used to it. Battery was draining in Android 8 but after the update of Android 9, this issue is resolved. The phone has a 8GB RAM and 128GB internal storage (though it also has a 6GB + 64GB). You can use as many as 40-50 apps at a time (in the background) without any lag. Overall the OnePlus 6 is the best phone in the price range of below 40k.",5
Perfect piece,5
"its so good to have a device like this soo fast so amazing look but one thing i am not satisfied with is its back glass, its been broken and not so durable. its just fall from my hand and the bach glass broken instantly and its really soo heart breaking.",5

Aswm phone... excellent speed.. excellent battery...,5
"The best phone I have ever had. The picture quality is awesome! Really fun to play with.  The processor is super fast, have never seen a lag in all the months I have used it. Compared to the last mobile I owned, this one is almost divine luxury! lol..
The battery is also really great. I can charge it up and have no fear till I get back home at end of day. This is despite all the 4G browsing, and WiFi if am not going out, music, videos, and the near constant use of GPS!! This phone has made me feel safe, and that's saying something! If there was a brand I would love to follow, this is OnePlus. :)",5

"Used mobile more than 3 weeks,  super performance, go for it.",5
Good product,5
"Absolutely love it! Its fast, never lagged (even in split screen) , games load as fast as than any other premium phones (tested alongside s9 and iphone x), camera is clear and crisp. Low ligh images are good , under light conditions it's probably one of the best ones in the market. New updates rolled out with Android pie(love it) security patches every month and the major plus point would be the battery life. It senses your app usage and optimizes the phone accordingly. Single charge on a heavy use can last upto 6hrs on full on screen time, average usage gives about 24hours(mobile data on, social networking apps running ), if you're a light user, it'll last around 36hours. Charging is quick(very). Only let down would be the speakers on the piece, they're loud but do not get that good feel. Could've been better at this price range. Too much volume can cause distortion and they don't feel good to the ear. Apart from that absolutely the speed you need‚ô•Ô∏è
PS: I'm using a 6gb ram version and tested it along side 8gb ram, they have the same performance just that the 128gb storage additional. And the phone comes with screen protector on and a case with it, special mention the case is as good as any durable case available in the market. Dropped it a couple of times by accident never had a scratch on it. Works like a charm",5

I am not satisfied with the product sound is not good working is not proper plz replace my phone,1
Good phone with latest features.,4
Not worth it. Updates removes existing features. So ultimately it means buy an upgraded phone that OnePlus launches 6 months or probably every year.,1
Class apart,5
One plus is the best.,5

"I got the phone on 17th of Sept 2018 with an exchange for my Microsoft Lumia 640xl. I got 2.6k for my old phone thanks to Amazon for it's extra 2k exchange offer. After the use of phone I like to say it's sound quality is good not exceptional. Because of it processor ram and storage under it's hood make this phone a beast. OnePlus 6t is rolling out if I had waited for a month I would have bought that. Still comapred with 6t what I feel is 6t doesn't have drastic upgrades. It's a OnePlus 6 with in screen finger print scaner. I missed that sandstom phone case offer while buying now am regrating for that.
Rest all is freaking awesome in the phone.",5
Very nice,5

"OnePlus 6 is the best Smartphone available at the Price at Rs. 34,999 which is very agressive & Best Price.
I just bought before a month & from then I am Using it & my Experience is very Nice.
You will be loving the Phone after You Start using this Smartphone.
OnePlus is the Best Brand available for Flagship Smartphones.
I Love using OnePlus products. My user experience is very Good With This Smartphone.
It Offers alot in this Price Range than other Smartphone Companies.
Its Specifications & Features provides me the Best Experience.
Its good as it is said 'The Speed You Need'
Its Snapdragon Qualcom 845 Processor Chipset gives me best experience in multitasking & gaming.
And the company gives updates also fast which is again very good for the Smartphone Users.
Its Midnight Black colour is very good in looks. It gives me A Premium Look in Hands.
I just wished for the more battery capacity. It has 3300 mah battery.  But still it gives the full one day usage to Me.",4

"Thus, OnePlus has made a kind of ""Android iPhone"" which i mean the Android phone with no lags, hanging and even more speed.. OnePlus community fans might expect lot more in the future models i hope they never disappoint us.. 5/5 for this now! With Great Battery Backup it charges within 1:15mins and discharges very slowly that's what slow thing this phone has",5
"Its definitely not what is promises. Shifting from iPhone, I had high expectations from the phone but it turned out to be totally a cheap Chinese phone. There are Basic call quality issues like When you are on phone with person A and person B calls up (whose call lands into waiting), suddenly person A will stop hearing whatever you say. You will need to disconnect and call back person A to talk.
Camera hangs and apps open up automatically when you are on call. The notification center is buggy and camera button on lock screen doesn't work smoothly.
If you are shifting from an iPhone, where your are used to excellent quality and performance but avoid this phone",1

"This phone is definitely worth the price. Do not compare it with Oppo/Vivo/Xiaomi. Belongs to a different class. Battery is immortal. I charge it in the morning, takes 30 mins or so to 100% and gives me a full day heavy usage with it. Though memory is low as of 64gb but then you can carry a 64/128 gigs of type c otg pen drive.",5
I am used in 2 months the phone is too good,5

I have made a right decision to switch to OnePlus6 from iPhone 6S. OnePlus6 has much better speed and performance as compared to iPhone 6S. With Android Pie you can experience New Pie UI,5
Ultimate phone ever got,5
"A great design, great performance. Smooth Ui I've ever seen.
I disliked the no memory card option, secondary camera is just only for depth sensing. 20mp for that is too much wastage.

OnePlus 6T waiting,5
"Got Gorgeous OnePlus 6 RED week before. I'm pretty impressed with its slimmer and gorgeous design.
It's really so beautiful. I have used many Android smartphones in past like HTC, Lenovo, moto, and most of them Samsung but from now I'm oneplus fan because of its sexy look, cool design, awesome display, extra ordinary camera and great performance speed.ü§ü
It's really so fast like 'speed you need' and best value for money.
I have couple of suggestions for oneplus.
1) Improve camera provide stickers and filters options. Animoji will be great if you can include that.
2) I know oxygen Os is itself awesome and well customized but it'll be great if you add your own OnePlus theme store like HTC and Samsung where users can customize their smartphone with more themes and wallpapers.
If you can provide these updates then I'm sure most of Samsung and other smartphone users will not gonna stop themselves to being OnePlus family :)
I hope you'll consider my opinions.
Thanks",5

"Amazing flagship phone by OnePlus. Truly a flagship killer and amazing mobile experience. Super amoled display, flagship processor sd 845, dash charger and oxygen os are the main highlight of this phone. Got this at 30k after exchange , discount on my HTC.

No words are there to express how good the phone..the feel to hold such a beauty is exceptional..though i found the battery life not so good but dash charge is there..camera at night requires lot of precision to click pics..screen diplay and sound is one of the best..save ur money and but this rather than the 90k phone,5

Up to the mark,5
Totally defective product received,1
The best mid range bugdet smartphone you can ever get..... Best flagship according to me in India.... Both camera centric and gaming phone... Great speed with Qualcomm Snapdragon 845... Don't need to say more.. just go for it .. thank you OnePlus....,5
It's very good phone,5
Guys at this price its the best you can get.,5
Awesome,5
Awesome phone I ever used.,5
"It's amazing phone, much appreciated!!",5
Battery needs improvement as it stands 8-10 hrs of daily usage. Good to have dash charge but can't carry it everywhere so needs battery improvement.,4
Good Camera,4
The one plus was not good as company says no sound quality no battery life,1
I got phone on sep 29. Battery is draining from day 1. I have raised a replacement request and technician has visited and saying that 2% for 5min is a normal drain. They are not ready to replace as there is no issue with the phone. Such a poor experience with amazon,1
"Oneplus has come far down the road providing great smartphones at half the cost of what other smartphone comoanies are charging. This is my second one plus & I'm not at all disappointed by my choice after shifting from iPhone 7. So let's begin with the review. My review is based on after & before getting the Android Pie update & using it for nearly 2 month or so.
Cons
- I really hoped that oneplus should have given me IP rating for the cost they are charging. Had high hopes after coming from iPhone 7.
- Camera quality is good. But not great. Pictures turn out to be soft even I'm now running on android pie official version. It's kind of a let down for the price as even Samsung & MI phones are delievering great image quality without softing the image.
- Another let down for me is that OP6 doesn't has stereo sound. I don't want to say that sound quality is bad; infact it's great but having dual speakers could have been great! (Helps me to watch late night movies over phone)
- Okay! So this one is personal. I really don't know how to set keyboard shortcuts. But I would really like OP to provide us keyboard shortcuts in their own launcher. Like in iPhone I could quickly type in a shortcut as fb & the whole word facebook would come in.
- I really wished for a 2k display but HD+ is also acceptable. But the fact that they are not using fully Amoled panels like in Samsung devices is a let down for me. I really love the Samsung Amoled display. They are the best when it comes to screen quality & color rendition.
- After Android Pie update; I really hate that we have to click the 3 dot icon over the recent apps to lock, use multi window etc! I would really like OP to work on this & provide us a better solution to lock out apps from recent apps menu & use multi window.
Pros
-Battery life for me before & after the Pie update has been just exceptional. Dash charging is best in business since my last use of OP3. I game a lot. Based on playing Pubg, Pes18, Modern Combat 5. The battery life has been great. Despite dropping to 88% from 100% after playing one classic match in Pugb; dash charging charges the phone in no time & later I can go on for my work.
- Customisation is on whole new level. If you're iOS user & use this there is world's difference. I really like how I can customise my DND settings, icons, homescreen etc.
- Finger Print scanner & face ID works like a charm. They unlock so fast that I'm barely able to look my notifications over the lock screen.
- Alert slider is the best thing which has come to android i.e in OP. I really liked iPhone's mute switch & on android side I suppose only oneplus has done it which is just amazing as one doesn't even need to pull down their phone notification to mute it during important meetings.
This review is based on both Android Oreo & Pie updates. I was very much suprised when I got the Pie update. Though it has minor bugs but those will be fixed soon in the next update.
I really like how people say iOS being simplistic; but on android side OP has yet again proven that my switching from iOS to android again is not a regretfull decision.
For people who are trying to decide between OP6t & OP6 I would say OP6 is better choice if you are willing to sacrifice headphone jack then sure go ahead. And people who are looking to upgrade from OP3/3t this is the right one. Those who already own OP5/5t jumping to OP6/6t won't be wise decision since oneplus is already supporting android pie updates till OP3! Another 6 month wait & you might get a great phone! Who knows!? Kudos!",5

"Two cons:
1 major - average battery life. If you are a youtube user, you will need to top it up in the evening.
1 minor - camera could be better. Admittedly this is not a. 60k flagship, but 40k is a lot of money and they need to do better to justify this price tag.
Display, performance, software UI are all amazing and beyond reproach.",4

A best phone..,5
Ultimate phone I ever used,5
"Reviewing after 1 week of use.
Initially I had a few issues with the GPS of this device - all location related apps would not work, but after the Android P update, things are fine.
Overall, a fairly powerful phone in all respects. Camera effects are also nice. But even with a configuration of this kind, some apps hang or crash.
Another issue is that the free Sandstone black cover that was part of the deal got cracked within 7 days of use - with just regular use - no hard impacts at all.
Some of the basic things are surprisingly good - because these days a lot of manufacturers are focusing on fancy stuff but ignoring basic things like call quality etc. But in this phone, call clarity is amazing. And the speaker of this phone is simply outstanding - very loud and clear when using it for conference calls. Battery life has also been quite satisfactory so far.
Overall, a great buy, but some small issues still remain - and the quality of the back cover is really low - deducting one star for that.",4
"19.5:9 is not upto mark for all applications.

See you don't have to wait for your phone to charge it will charge in like 30 mins to 60% the screen is also average even with optic AMOLED screen it's not Soo satisfying as my previous phone s8 has a really great display the clarity and everything was great on that phone .....

Its a great phone given the price.i am pretty much satisfied with the battery and the display. Also has got a nice display. Fast charging is also pretty good. Phone is very snappy with snapdragon 845. Camera is not at par with pixel and iphone but given the price range u won't regret it. Face unlock is the fastest we have in the market. Fingerprint unlock is also very snappy. The only downside is the speaker that is very tiny.,4
Good,4
"The best phone at this price point. I am using it since last 1 month and found no issues til now. Recommended to all the people, go for it. It is really a great experience using OnePlus 6.

One plus is the most amazing phone I had in my hand I jus love it thank you amazon for the quickest delivery of d product,5
Excellent product,5
Sound quality should be better,5
"The brightness control is pathetic.... 1 to 4 % it gives likes half of brightness of phone.... And from 50 to 100% the brightness is almost the same.
Since there is no music player of its own.... It makes the experience for normal life boring becquse players from playstore are not what you want if you love hall effects.
Except these everything is perfect and yeah the face scanner unlocks the phones even if you are not looking at it",4

"Its great phone , fast , fluid and easy for day to day work , speaker sound is on the slower side otherwise rest is ok. Apart from the phone the cashback which has been mentioned while purchasing has not been credited by amazon . Because it has been mentioned that for a particular bank debit or credit card no promo code is required and yet no refund yet . Hope its not a gimmick to just show this offer on purchase while check out",4

Amazing battery and camera,5
"My experience with this 8 GB - 128 GB phone bought last month is it is an excellent phone and value for money.  I also use Apple 8 as an alternate phone, but this scores higher in terms of options / facilities provided, speed and storage apart from the versatility of latest android. It charges very fast, has good security features, facility to lock apps for privacy etc.
For all those looking for a top-end phone in the range of 30,000 plus, this is a good option.",5
This is the second mobile am buying totally addicted to it,5

If you have budget of 35k then blindly buy it because it worth it every single penny,5
"Ok reviewing it after almost a month of use. First and foremost things I'd like to come up with is its screen quality. I got a few scratches even after using it so delicately and finally i had to cover it with a tempered glass. You don't expect such things from a product which costs you 35000. Battery hardly stands upto 8 hours after heavy use. Referring to pubg play time, it is lower than 4 hours.
Camera is good. You can't complain about that.
But yeah heating problem can compete with Mi Phones and can even beat them sometimes. It heats up very much.",2
"Display,Software & Ram management is very good.Battery life lasts for one day under moderate usage.Best Value for money in terms of quality & awesome lag free experience in everyday mobile functions.",5

Speed of phone is awesome,5
Poor,1
"this phone comes with unprecedented features which u can expect from an iphone. I hv bn an iphone user but the speed & performance r above par. You wl feel cruising thru air while using this phone. Only demrit is battery life, it must comes with more mAH power. Bcz battery is the sole source which allow u to explore the features of any phone. However, Dash charging wd provide u quick backup. Overall I am satisfied.",5
Excellent this is the best option for dual Sim phone,5
"Worst mobile
West of money",1
"Over the years I have used Onplus 1, 3, 5 and now got 6.
For reviewing only OnePlus 6
- Battery backup is good, has 25-30% juice left by end of day under normal usage (Calls, 4g, WiFi, Bluetooth, gaming etc combined).
- Dual 4G Volte is supported.
- Display can be very bright and colors are vibrant. Not less than any premium display.
- Oxygen OS as fast and snappy as ever. Updates and patches are on time
- I use Airtel and Jio, full signal bars most of the volte.
- Crystal clear voice when calls are connected over volte in HD.
- Excellent Camera and OIS.
- Above average design but not unique.
- Medium size notch
- Blocking bottom speaker will not cut off sound completely.
- Soft Back cover, Screen guard came along.
- Dash charger works like it did for previous ones.
So one can't go wrong at all with this One unless you get a faultly piece. But I am worried that I don't feel I am getting enough for its price vs what OnePlus 1 or even OnePlus 3 offered for their price.
Ofcourse every year OnePlus will come out with latest processor and will definitely have Oxygen OS with steep increase in its pricing but that is not what I can say as 'Never Settle'. Maintaining just standard level of latest specs doesn't match its motto. Need something extra, something unique, out of the box kind that others can't even think to offer to bring that excitement back and to justify increase in price. Adding features piece by piece with every 6 month is not very compelling.
Now even good brands are coming up with similar specs in similar or lower price.
Before this I got to use Asus Zenfone 5z for few months and I must say it was awesome. Charged as fast as OnePlus, has Dual Volte, their Zen UI is as fast and snappy as Oxyzen OS but at the same time their are lot features inbuit like Phone Manager. Display is less bright but more punchy, Camera is not as good as that of OnePlus 6 but the secondary camera really bring some difference by wide angle shots. AI feature they use is helpful in many things charging slowly overnight and increasing battery life or in short everything I could think of I needed after coming from OnePlus 5 was available and much more. I am not saying it was perfect, face unlock was very slow and didn't work most of the times but still it had FM radio, came with a nice earphone and after having these all it is priced 5k less, weights 20g lesser and heavy discount are available on it from time to time.
I really hope OnePlus does something different in future release or it will be taken over by good brands offering more in less price.",3

"Love the phone. Unbeatable phone in this price range. Super fast, large screen, good hand feel. Fingerprint scanner is fast",5
Its truly the SPEED YOU NEED.,5
Extremely delighted to recieve the most highly rated flagship android smartphone of 2018. Thanks to Amazon. Exchange of my old handset device was smooth and hasslefree at a great price. Received the product within the stipulated time as per my convineince.,4
Product is very bad,1
Awesome Handset I seen ever....It's Unbelievable.. Battery performance was also good as fast charging..But Increase More like 4000 mah,5
Good product,5
"If you're looking to replace an OP3 or 3T, or any year-and-a-half or older phone. With the OnePlus 6 you'd be getting a solid all round camera experience, a display that's better than most, and software that's feature-rich, plain and fast all at the same time. Plus battery life that may not be class leading, but charging tech that is.
Pros
The increased price is still much lower than current top-end phones
Super fast charging, good battery life
Oxygen OS has a stock look, but offers more features, and is blazing fast
The improved primary camera kinda makes up for the meaningless secondary one
Cons
What are we to do with a claimed water resistance but no IP rating?
A proper telephoto/ultra-wide camera would be more useful
No microSD slot, no wireless charging, no headset in the box, proprietary charging peripherals",4
"In one word it's just ""DOPE"".. I purchased it specifically for its camera.. I am a mobile photographer and videographer, and I wanted to upgrade from my redmi note 5 pro.. The over all performance of this fon is just amazing üòç thanks to the SD845 chip and 6GB ram... The manual control of the camera is just dope.. The ability to shoot raw with this Phones makes me like it even more... The dynamic range of the camera is amazing at this price range... The 4k recording at 60 fps is just jaw dropping üòçüòç though it does 240 fps in 1080p, I prefer 4k in 60fps for that extra crunch in the quality... But its good to know if does 240fps in full HD.. Might come in handy.. I just stepped into videography and I am loving the quality of this phone... U can check its cinematic footages output in youtube @Jaywrat Binnani
Over all I am satisfied with this phone and its camera.. Just one thing I did not like was its dual camera implementation.. I wud have liked if there was a telephoto or an ultra wide angle 2ndary lens instead of that gimmicky fake DOF creating sensor, which btw can be achieved with a single camera these days too üòáüòá otherwise I love it.!",5
"There's no second thought about oneplus 6 its literally a speed you need , however all the offers which is provided by amazon are so unreal. For example  The offer which stated add ‚ÄúOnePlus 6 Sandstone Protective Case‚Äù to card and the same will be free during the checkout. Its fake i did it and the case was chargeable. Dear amazon correct me if i am wrong.",4
All performance is great,4
"No complaints with phone. However as per amazon terms I purchased using my HDFC card and eligible for Rs. 1500/- cash back. I do not know whether it will come or not. Last year I purchased one plus 5 on same terms and condition, no cash back came. Can someone look at it.",4
"OnePlus 6 is a complete package in all senses.
1. Superb performance with top notch SD845
2. Great camera, both front & rear. Night pictures are also good.
3. Dash charge is one of the fastest (infact fastest).
4. Stunning design with glass & aluminium.
5. Stock Android like oxygen os is cherry on cake.
6. Absolute flagship killer by all senses.
7. Love the gestures.",5
Nice phone outstanding performance picture quality is good battery is also good . speed is supper .,5
#thespeedyouneed It's just opposite of this tagline. Sharing very honest review here for OnePlus 6. It's not worth for 36k as it doesn't have flagship camera as well as 6 GB RAM also gives you lacking problems and hanging problem. Oxygen OS updates are very slow and doesn't work with Android properly. But phones battery backup is too good and fast charging gives you more relaxation during travelling. But overall OnePlus needs to improve this variant a lot. This is my first and last experience with OnePlus.,4
This phn service is very badly .. 3tyms screen problem bt no solution by service center..,1
"I just love OnePlus 6 and a fan of OnePlus, already used OnePlus 3 and 5. But disappointed because in a very short time OnePlus launched it new OnePlus 6t.",5
Gr8 Mobile @ Gr8 Price,5
Mobile is superb. They will charge 35000 rupees but they will not provide back screen gaurd.,5
"Awesome mobile... Loved the customization of apps..  low light  pics come good too... Though felt bit expensive, worth it...",5
Awesome phone performance is the best in this phone can go for it been using for almost 4 months,5
This mob is my favourite and camer clerity,5
Value for money,5
"Have been using Oneplus 6 Midnight Black 8Gb+256Gb variant for 2 months now and I can clearly tell its a kickass phone which even beats the Pixel 2 in performance. Amazing battery life and really smooth software experience make you fall in love with this beauty. Even if you have many other phones with similar specs, the fluidity of oxygen OS makes the Oneplus 6 stands on top of all that. Previously I have been using the Oneplus two and I really have become the fan of this company. Heard they are making Oneplus tv in 2019. Really looking forward to it.",5
Marvelous artifact,5
Good,5

"Bought this phone about a month ago and this is my opinion after using it for a month.
I was using iOS since oast 9 years. The inly reason I sticked to iOS for son long is it's stability over the android. However, after seeing the features and advancement of android over iOS since past couple of years, I decided to switch it to Android. Just I had question about the hardware configuration. Hence, I wanted the best hardware configuration for my device which eliminate all the slowness possibilities for Android device.
About hardware:
The outer case is premium in feel and touch. The display ratio to body is perfect. You won't notice any borders as such on all corners. Display is pretty vivid and touch is suoer responsive. The device feels sturdy enough to handle small and medium impacts. The side buttons are easy to operate and does not feel too soft or too notchy either.
Camera:
Camera is not super but definitely a good one. There are lot of ootions in Pro mode just like we get un DSLR. You can set everything custom as per your requirement like focus, aperture, ISO, shutter soeed etc which eill results in very customisable photos.
Sound and Microphone:
Siund at loudspeakers are perfect and audible even in crowded places. Earpiece for calling fullfills the expectatios. Since Oneplus dies not provide the headphones in box, you can use any 3.5 mm headphones. I am using Apple earpods with thus device with no issues for music and calling and the music experience is not different than any iOS device.
Battery backup:
I simoly love the dadh charging technology of this device. It charges uoto 40 prr cent of battery just in 10 minutes. Overall battery backuo is upto the mark. A single charge will be sufficient with heavy internet usage for a day.
Overall performance:
Yes. This device does heats up a bit when you play any high end games for approx 30 minutes which is very natural as you are using all it's components at extereme levels for better gaming experience. But again, even the battery performance is suoerb for gaming too.
Few areas for improvement:
There are some areas in terms of user UI experience which Oneplus needs to improve a bit. Like other Android devices, this also keeps a lot of garbage files on you ROM which you need to clear time to time. Of course, it won't cause any slowness but it will definitely occupy a space on your ROM.
FINAL verdict:
I woukd definitely recommend this device because even other high end Android devices does not cone uo with such configuration at this orice tag. Snapdragon 845 with 640 GPU packed with 6/8 GB RAM is an astonishing combination in this price bucket.",5
Faster than the fastest...... Loved this product,5
"I think no one can beat this one plus 6.
Great features at this price and specially the overall quality of the phone is awesome.

"Phone is one of the best in this range with almost all best features added in single device. I am writing this after using this phone for almost 3.5 months.
Pros:
1. Battery life is good, if not playing very heavy games, battery will run for more than 24hours.
During night(8 hours) hardly 2% is decreased with wifi on.
2. Gaming mode, reading mode, alert slider are added usefull features. I use them alot.
3. Phone is waterproof, i used this phone under a waterfall near ooty. No issue at all, camera was working fine no issue after that. Just kept phone in sun for 2 mins to make it dry.
4. Hardware is strong and non-delicate inspite of mirror back. I dropped this phone 5-6 times already, no issue no dents till now. Thanks to oneplus sandstone cover as well.
4. Camera is one of the best i used so far. Pro mode is all magic. Selfie cam improved since last update.
Cons
1. Audio is ok ok. Though depends on earphones you are using. Speaker audio is just fine, anyways who likes to listen to songs on phone speakers. I use earphones or BT speakers.
2. Mirror back is slippery, cover is must.
3. Charger is bulky.... Oneplus please make it bit smaller.",5
Best phone . Worth a buy. Will not get disappointed .,5
"I bought this phone for my brother in law, so i have no personal experience to share regarding the usage of the phone. But I am using 3T device for the last one and a half year and 3T is an awwwwwwesome device. Considering this i am 110% sure that 1+6 should be way more better than 3T. My brother in law is also very satisfied with this phone.  Hope i can upgrade my 3T next year or next to next year with 1+7 or 1+8 üòÅüòÅüòÅ",5

"Amazing phone. Have been using this since more than 2 months now.
Amazing build quality but still I am using a protective case from tudia. The glass back gives me tension.
The phone is amazingly fast & fluid.
Don't have to bother about multiple apps opened in background as the SD 845 takes care of the heavy processing.
10nm architecture shows in the great battery optimization. Also, the dash charger. It's amazingly fast.
This is my first OnePlus devices.
Hoping to keep it as long as possible.",5

Every thing is good about dis phone.But they don't provide free sand stone case with purchase of one plus 6 mobile.I have ordered the phone(add both to cart) and received the same after two days without the sand stone cover. I wondered is this the selling technique.,5

Best phone I have ever purchased. It was delivered to me on 15/8/18. But today back panel damaged. Now how should I proceed as free 12 month accidental insurance (kotak 811)was there in special offers at the time of purchase.,5
The mobile is very fast. It can run multiple apps at once without any problem. The battery is good. I had received a defective product initially. After a week of use it started giving problems like my headphone jack stopped working. I contacted amazon and got a replacement hassle-free. Very good service.,5
Bettery back up is very worst...,3

"I got the phone delivered yesterday, on time! Awesome camera and battery life!",4
"Excellent phone...all the features are best, camera s good, if at all anything s lacking it's battery life, but dash charge overcomes it",5
"Product itself is amazingly good for the price, but we can see where it excels and where it has indeed cut corners. Camera quality is still not upto flagship level, but definitely improved over previous gen Oneplus devices,Daylight shots are crisp and retain lot of details but when it comes to low light it contradicts. Oneplus has to go long way to achieve flagship level camera performance specially in low light scenarios it is very much evident with grainy images and subject does not seem to be properly highlighted. Battery life is another grey area it needs to improve big time, one could just do away for a whole day on moderate usage but still one needs to be very resourceful while using for entire day, specifically when you are heavy cellular data user, despite of all sorts of optimization you might need to charge at the end of the day. If you are a heavy user then in mid day, you might want to carry your dash charger along. Performance is perhaps the key ingredient of Oneplus, it shines here and is blazingly fast, Oxygen OS is quite snappy with any sorts of apps n games. Also another thing to consider, frequency of updates is really good, so you know your device is improving all the time. Dash charge helps to replenish the battery quickly, is one of the fastest charging standards around for a smartphone, comes in very handy on occasions you forgot to charge your phone and have just few mins to spare. Build quality is perhaps another area where Oneplus has worked a great deal to make it look more premium device and it does indeed feels great in hand and weight seems to be rightly balanced, with right blend of solid design and great asthetics, certainly justifies its price upgrade over previous generation. Amoled panel is of really good quality with dynamic range of colors without any prominent colour shift, one would thoroughly enjoy media consumption on it, as well as Outdoor visibility is also really good, no issues here wigh brightness levels. Sound quality via single loudspeaker is disappointing though, and seems lacking body to its sound n loudness level seems just average at best. As a part of promotion Oneplus 6 is providing free sandstone cover but the seller( Rocket kommmerce LLP is not shipping one here, and on query is not taking any responsibility for it either and blaming Amazon fulfillment service for it, if one doesn't get it. It should not be such a big issue afterall to ship a simple cover as even official Oneplus 6 india site is giving it away for free, I would recommend to buy from Oneplus 6 official site and not from here).",1
Good,5
Sound is not crisp as other below 15k smart phones. Also fails to understand how to impart the blurring effect in the background while capturing photo. Otherwise camera is good. In my previous mobile Lenovo k8 note there was clear laid out procedure for the bokeh effect. Can somebody guide me how to operate the portrait mode  bokeh effect. Overalls is an excellent phone. Hope sound  can be fixed in the next update. It is also not supporting VR.,4
The phone is really doing well. It has met all the expectations.,5
All good expect battery life,5

"Best in class, highly recommended",5
"The sound after 2 months of purchase has suddenly become v low. The ringer volume is also low and I can't hear when there are videos on WhatsApp or you tube. Though the customer care is helpful and I followed all their instructions, I still have to visit the repair center in Nehru place. They don't have one in Noida. This is inconvenient and they provide a pick up and drop facility but that will take 10-12 days. So I need the phone faster and it means taking a day off just to sit at the repair center
The phone otherwise has been good, while I do understand this can happen to any device, it's just been 2 months and it is a pain.",3
This is  Awesome .,5

Now its been just 2 month old, and my phone is continuously hanging. It started out slowly but now its more frequent. Even the sound keeps increasing by itself while I watch a video. If this is what is happening in just 2 months, don't know whether it will last even a year. And for this price, it's just not worth it.",3

The best phone I've ever used,5
Best quality,5
Spikar quality not good,4
One plus 6 have very good camera and video recording has noise canceling. When you are playing turn gaming mode on then you'll not be disturbed. Battery gets quickly charged and lasts for 1 day. The full screen display is the best of this phone,5
"it working very slow.....i bought onepluse 6 128 +8gb ram.....but in one month i going a service station.
..
But it working almost slow...",1
"i have been the first users of one plus one and then moved onto the one plus 3t, Now my daughter after using an an iphone for 2 years, used my discarded 1plus one and then asked for a one plus 6 as the next replacement. she is a media person and is thrilled by its speed and photography and video features which is almost as good as a professional device. .",5
product is good,5
Funny Thing in Exchange.....one plus isn't accepting it own old models in exchange of one plus 6...Thats hilarious,3
Best mobile of the year... Thank you one plus for giving this premium experience in affordable price range.,5
"The battery life is good if you're a casual user but if you are buying this you surely are a heavy user and the battery performance will be average for you but dash charging makes up for the battery. Camera is amazing and clicks photos which can question other big talking camera centric flagships during the day. At night the photos are good but a bit grainy. The bottom speaker is loud but tinny. And now let's talk about performance, no hiccups, not a single frame drop in games, apps just opens up when you tap on the icon. It makes life so simple. And after using this phone for a couple weeks I used a friend's Galaxy S8 and was shocked to see how Samsung and it's bloatware filled ROM slows thier phone down drastically. Everyone is using this phone not because of the bang for buck pricing or to save money. This phone is actually in the leagues of current crops of flagships and you should order one for yourself without a blink of an eye. The only gripe for me so far after looking at the pricing and performance is battery life. Thank god they got Dash charging anf the ship it with the phone.",5

"Hi guys I am writing review after 2 days of extensive using of one plus six .
Screen is crisp and sound
Phone gives you premium look
Operation is smooth without any lag
Reading mode is awaysome.kibdle lover will be happy.
I play pubg for nonstop 2 hours on no lag default settings is hd and high graphics
Ram management is good
Camera is great
Iow light pitchers required optimization.
I choose this phone over Asus because my past experience is not good with Asus Zenfone.
Also with only 4 k I get amooled display.
Speker sound is ok not loud
Call are clear and crisp.
All in all I say go for it.
This phone is give you what iPhone x will give in 100000 RS.
Don't fall for you tubers review about Zenfone and pocofone.
One plus has some class if you looking for class and not any cheep flagship killer junk .buy one plus six",5

"You probably know enough about the phone from countless reviews online. I'll just tell you that after some months of usage (I got the phone on the first day of its release) I'm very satisfied and have recommended it to two people who bought it too. As a regular user, I've had no trouble so far. Chances are, you won't either. If you're in the market for a phone in this price range, go for this without a second thought.",5
"The one plus is far best mobile in the price , performance segment you can buy the mobile blindly the battery back up is awesome the speed is superb",5
It's a very good product,5

I like this performance and I did not like battery life and storage at this price of the phone.but this is the best phone for gaming and performance in all around.,4
Nice,5
This is a good phone with high end specification & OLED display. This phone is water resistant for daily use.It can survive weather and accidental dip in liquid. This phone has a lovely dual camera with optical image stabilization. The  secondary lens does not have OIS. The low light light perfomence of the camera is awasome. This phone has 6.28-inch Optic AMOLED display with sRGB supports DCI-P3 colour space. This phone is with 19:9 aspect ratio and also there is a 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection. This phones heart is Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 along with LPDDR4X RAM. The overall perfomence is super and good. i like it very much. The phone is quickly charged. no heating issue. i can play almost all games without any lags.,4
I like the processer speed and the camera,5

Any way expectations of one plus is less than we imagineeeee...i using this mob for the past 2 to 3months...not go for ittttt",1
An Amazing product from OnePlus!!  The offer made by Amazon on the protective cover is not clear.  If you are making an exchange you do not have an option to claim the protective cover. Upon calling the customer care is when you are made aware that you are not eligible on exchange.  Otherwise worth the money and good exchange offer!,5
Good,5

"OnePlus 6 is greatest yet cheapest phone out there. I am not a fan of notch what is this new fad anyway I have gifted this to my sister and she does seem to concerned about notch and she loved the phone,
Pros-
Battery
Screen
Selfy portrait mode
Camera front and back
Fingerprint scanner
Headphone jack
Cons-
Heats up initially but found that new update was causing the same OnePlus sent new update and all is well now
Great update support",5
Bad Camera,3
"It's an amazing phone ..
I was a iPhone user for almost 5 years and now switched to Android for the first time ( before iOS I was using Windows phone) .. I must say OnePlus Oxygen OS skin is really cool just like stock Android.
Camera is fantastic , sound quality ,call reception is amazing.I didn't expect battery life to be such a good with 3000 mag batter but for a average user like me ( I am not a gaming fan ) it lasts more than a day easily.
Overall One Plus has done an amazing job .. keep it up.",5
"Although it good products but few things which i did'nt like. Touchscreen work if it is touches with nominal things like cloths, pencil,pen nail and so on . Even pocket mode is on.
Internet connectivity kick offf while talking through an another sim.so if i want to use internet during call than i cant. Else i have to switch the both on same sim which is not possible, i think.",3

Like,5
Everything is good,4
The Phone is simply superb.No issues regarding speaker. It actually Justifies the title name "THE SPEED YOU NEED". loved the phone,5
Very good,5
"I bought this phone almost 3 months ago and I think I am eligible to write a review for One Plus 6. Let's talk about some Pros First :
1) Great Display And Looks. Glass Back is very premium looking.
2) The Performance is Insanely Good
3) The Camera Quality Is Pretty Nice. Both front Camera and Rear.
4) The EIS and OIS ensures a very stable video
5) Fast Charging is so amazing. I was shocked when I first saw this device getting charged so fast. Definitely one of the best features of this phone.
6) The face unlock is fast too but I don't use it much. However, the fingerprint scanner is quick and that's something I use on a regular basis. The face unlock doesn't really work in low light conditions so you won't be able to unlock your phone in dark unless you've enabled the flash which only makes the process a lot longer than just using fingerprint scanner or a pattern.
Now to the Cons :
1) Even though it looks very premium, the glass back seems to be really fragile. You don't really want to drop this phone without a cover on it otherwise that glass back may get some cracks in it.
2) The video recorded from front camera is great but you can't use it if you want to record yourself playing a guitar and singing ( Or doing some other similar activity). The noise cancellation makes the audio really terrible.
3) I feel like they should've made some efforts on Audio. Audio feels a bit less clear from the Mono Speaker given that even less expensive phones give a better audio output.
That's it. There's not much to complaint about OP6 and so far I'm loving this phone. The speed is amazing and the looks are great.
Advice for you people who will buy it : Please use Official Tempered Glass ! I ordered a fake one before and it was bad. Dust entered the glass and in front of Camera. So I had to order an official one. It's perfect",4
Super Awesome,5
Nice one best fone with good options,5
This is best smartphone for this price range,5
Loved it,5

"Hi,
This review is after almost 1 month of use.
I am a typical iPhone user since iPhone 4.
Thought of trying one plus 6 as I wanted a decent double sim phone (which was not available in iPhone).
Because of all hype about one plus 6, I choose to go for this against Samsung‚Äôs Note 8.
To my surprise, I got faulty phone, whose mike was not working and when I restarted the phone the phone did not start again at all.
After struggling and escalating the issue for about 10 days got the replacement.
Replacement phone is working fine.
Display is very good, battery life is decent. Sound is average. Picture quality is very good (very bright and detailed) (Still I like day pictures of iPhone and nights pics of Pixel XL)
Speed is good ( with some random app hang issues).
Reading mode is awesome.
All other aspects of the phone are excellent (built quality etc).
But I still feel for 40K, this phone is bit expensive.
This will get a lot of competition from Poco F1, and other flag ship phones.
People with tight budget should compare well and buy.",4
Just one word awesome,5
good one,5
I got an good experience in speed accessable and the dash charger is found good.,5
Picture quality is amazing,5
I didnot like the camera very much there should be more modes filters and IE,4
üëå,5
Add more camera feature....,4
"Liked the Performance, camera & dash charger.
Hate - battery life & headphone audio quality",4
The popularity of the product gives it's very strength.,5
Good phone,5
I bought this phone Only For IronMan Case üòç,5
Speed what u need,5
Good phone but price too high,5
Good product,4
Awesome üòç,5
"Phone is very good in this price range and the best thing is battery life, longer than compare to other. But one thing, HDR mode is very average in low light condition and it is not acceptable in this price.",4
"This phn. Is really oossamm , great sound quality and picture quality I really like this so much thanku amazone",5
"In this range, this is a beast...nice camera with a suburb software...phone is fast and furious...it's keep receiving new updates which is incredible and better than others..go for it without thinking soooooo much..",5
Not value for money as compared to Samsung.,2
Good. Average picture quality,4
"My speaker is not working, I thought it was water resistant but instead the speaker soaked the water inside it.",2
Best phone available in the market today. Superfast camera could be a little better,5
The phone has major camera issues. I switched from an iphone to oneplus 6 only to regret every moment. The camera is blurry and softens the picture even though beautification is turned off. It also gets heated up a lot and crashes after which the phone switches off,2
Love this phone. Looks very cool.. camera quality awsome. Delivery on time. Dual volte and sound quality also good.,5
Best phone best camera,5
Not even 1 percent regret!,5
Heavy,5
"Using this phone almost two months now. Used redme note 4 for 8 months and then shifted to one plus 6 for speed.
Trust and honest feedback: this is one of best phone currently available in market compared to other phone in this price range even 10/15k higher cost.
Don't go behind the only hardware configuration, software is more important Nd thats where one plus scores.
Best in software, speed and usability. Absolute zero in bugs and speed lacking.
The other important aspect is its technical support. Amazing you can call them any working day from 9am to 7pm and they guide you for any problem. Even on mail i asked few queries and they responded in couple of hours with exact answer. Best in class.
Finally i recommend so many phones in market are available at cheap cost or good adds, plz dont go behind them. Simply buy this phone and forget thinking or looking any phone add for atleast next 2 years. I used one plus one for almost 2.5yrs earlier.
Gave one less star for battery as this is high speed processor hence consume battery little quickly.
May be one plus should introduce low end processing speed option for less users so as their battery can go little more or give more capacity battery in next version. But nothing as such worry about battery life.
Finally will say am happy that i choose one plus 6 and suggest you simply go with this phone without thinking much.
Bought one plus 6 128gb version in july 2018.",5
Amazing mobile with good Cameras.,4

Aa,5
Absence of stereo speakers,5
"This is the worst experience I had with amazon. So if you buy from Amazon, and if the phone is a mess (which it is- an over priced waste of time), then you won't get your money back or a good service. One Plus would ask you to co-ordinate with amazon and Amazon would need a physical letter from one Plus stating their inability to provide a resolution.
Anyway.
Problems:
Constant Call Drop
Slow Processor compared to mi phones
Over priced for what it does
Keyboard acts funny when you have other apps in the background",1
Best phone,5

They hace made a well balanced performing beast for the price. The cameras are also improved. Outstanding build quality but a case is quite compulsory.

Stereo speakers could have made this flagship a 5 starrer,4
"Very good phone in the category, Potrait mode camera is best",5
I was very happy with he product but it's back glass is unbeilevably sensitive. Using the best Spigen cover in market and yet the back screen cracked with the lightest of bumps against a wall. Very disappointed with the brittlely of the back glass.,4
I bought it last month and so far I'm loving the camera quality and battery life. I have no complaints so far.,4
If i talk about that phone's bettery life is Not enough for me and Sound Quality Isn't well Or Other quality of phone  is justify the value..,5
"I like all the feature, fadu fn",5
"Best in market for gaming, battery life. Camera is average, focusing in selfie mode is flimsy and practically non existent. Pictures with back camera have a distinct reddish hue to them. Fingerprint recognition somehow deteriorates over time. Display is great, vibrant and bright. However screen is not very resilient. Develops scratches easily. Extremely slippery body. But usage is smooth, does not heat up. A good one.",4
"The oneplus 6 is the product which i dreamed to get, i have received a product 30.08.2018. Its performance, Camera all are superb, i enjoyed every day but.... within a week it was stolen by a stranger person at 08/09/2018 early morning 02:30, that was major lost in my life... i miss my oneplus6...",5

"Every thing viz... sound quality, battery life and picture quality are good. But, since the mobile gets heated up when the battery charge goes down from 50% charge and  hence unable to hold in hand continuously and can feel the  irritation in fingers. Unable to exactly find out the reason..... not satisfied...",3
One plus 6 is the best phone I purchased and it has value for money .the battery back up is good and camera is excellent except the night mode images.,5
"Picture quality is average
Overall performance is awesome",4

"Phone amazing ! But sound quality is not as I expected and battery is a smaller battery, I can play pubg for around 3 contineous hrs .but don't worry dash charger does it's job very fine. I recommend you to get a new scratch guard and case because the preapplied scratch  guard is worth nothing and back case is just normal silicon case better buy a new one like Spigen or kapaver , overall a good buy.",5

2) Superb speed.
3) Nice sound quality on speaker or on ear.
4) Good battery.
5) Great front and rear camera.
6) Shipped with a nice back cover that you don't need any other cover for protection.
7) Quick charging with the dash charger is really awesome. I see people charging the phone for a couple of hours to with for 100% but here you just have to wait 45 mins at max.
The only thing I miss in this is a radio.",5

Overall the phone is a flagship",5
"I liked the speed, sound quality, and the battery life. What I didn't like is the dual camera pictures. The portrait mode is just like any typical android portrait mode and it looks like the background is blurred using Photoshop. Also, the back cover provided to me was bit rugged and dirty. Also, it is not that protective for a phone like this. If you can live that, this phone is otherwise awesome!",5

"One of the best Flagship phone and that too in much less price as compared to Samsung LG, Sony etc.
First of few phones to receive the android pie beta and they are pushing continuous updates for beta.
Rear camera needs a lot of improvement as currently the software is not utilizing the AI capabilities of the Snapdragon 845 SOC. Once OP updates the firmware and software with AI capabilities for camera and other tasks this would be the best phone to have.",5
Could have provided more mah battery,5
"The speed is amazing!!
Battery lasts really long, and just a half n hour charge shall refill it effortlessly.. fingerprint sensor is lighting fast..display is crystal!!

Premium phone with good price,4
"Excellent performance truly awesome fastest charging, battery of 4000 mah and wireless charging should have been included with Better sound output from speaker.",4
It's really awesome. Easy to use.,5
"The phone is one of the Best in class product available out there. I have given a pros and cons for this phone below, but one of the key drawback I would highlight before we go there would be the battery life. With average usage, one would would need to charge the phone atleast twice a day. The Dash Charge definitely helps in covering up for this drawback, but still if you do not have access to the dash charge and/or you are travelling, the amount of charge that the battery holds will become an important factor.
PROS
1. The increased price is still much lower than current top-end phones
2. Super fast charging
3. Oxygen OS has a stock look, but offers more features, and is blazing fast
4. The improved primary camera kinda makes up for the meaningless secondary one.
CONS:
1. What are we to do with a claimed water resistance but no IP rating?
2. A proper telephoto/ultra-wide camera would be more useful
3. No microSD slot, no wireless charging.
4. Poor battery backup compared to many phoes available out there in the same price range.",5
Sound thru speaker could be improved else best phone of the one plus,5
Product is good. it's fast. only reason i gave one star because it had speaker issue. and any phone you buy should not need you to go a service center atleast for a year. it failed that criteria.,1
Cool phone I enjoy the divace,5
....,5
Nice product,5
Awesome Phone,5
Everything is just perfect ....but little disappointed bcz... sometimes it's hang when playing games....not expected with 6RAM,5
Nice,5
Just love this go for it dont listen to anyone,5
Super mobile,5
Nice mobile,5
I experienced slight heating while playing games such as sniper. Otherwise it's an excellent product.,4
No doubt this one of the best smartphone in this range . You can't go wrong with this,5
"I have been using this phone for last one month, I must say it's camera is really good, pro mode gives you enough power to take some really nice shots. Screen size is good , rarely any app supports 18:9 video so you will lose some if you stretch but sometimes it's good to watch on the whole screen.
One thing that I don't like is the battery life, it's really low , I have to charge it twice a day. It won't last more than 10 hours of normal usage. even if you just keep it idle in pocket with data and gps on it will die in about 12-14 hours.",3
Very Nice Phone with Great Performance.,5
Its just an awesome phome,5
"Liked it, easy to use , in budget with luxury",5
Excellent piece. I am very much satisfied battery is good stays the whole day 24hours.. fast charge and robust...picture quality is good,5

Lovely mobile,5
"This phone is a beast, it's looks  clean  and stealthy, but it catches so many finger prints if you're not clean.The gaming in this phone  is smooth as hell, the base model is more then enough for common user. Photography  on this phone is better then other in this price range. features like slow-mo ,time-laps, paranoma, portrait (boken) etc work flawless",5
It's little bit heavier than expected and not slim like previous models (5 and 5t). Dash charging is satisfactorily fine but not super amazing.,4
Very good,5

Worth buying,5
Just the best,5
Amazing phone by oneplus.,5
"The best gadg for value money.. low light photography is still relying over the software than the telephoto lens provided same problem is with the zoom which is optically active... Which brings it one point down when compared with pixel 2XL and note 9 .... Am I being greedy for so less money because you could actually buy couple of these sets while comparing it to google and apple flagships, great work, bbk-oneplus.. it really possess the lightening speed .. the speed you need and greed for üòäüëª",5

If you have 35k budget dont think twice. Go for it. In my experience 10/10 rating.,5
"OnePlus offers a huge number of features at prices that make big-name brands look quite out of touch. One of the biggest surprises about this phone is that it's only marginally more expensive than its predecessor 5T, despite the brand new screen, SoC, and beautiful glass body.

OnePlus 6's biggest omissions are wireless charging, an IP-rated weatherproof body, a high-res or HDR screen, stereo speakers, 3D face or iris recognition, AI enhancements, 960fps slow-motion, and HDR video recording.
The question then is how many of these features really matter enough for you to want to spend up to twice as much on one of those other phones? Sure, they'd be nice to have, but are you really missing out on something significant?
The OnePlus 6 is still gorgeous, extremely well crafted, supremely powerful, and fully capable of doing what most people want their phones to do.
At this price point this is the only option with a Snapdragon 845 right now. The software is both versatile and up-to-date which are both significant if you are planning to keep it for a while. This is also a phone you can show off quite proudly. I think that most people, especially OnePlus fans looking for an upgrade, will be quite satisfied with the OnePlus 6. I highly recommend this phone. You'll fall in love with it! ‚ù§",5

"This phone lags even in the most basic of tasks. Lags while scrolling, playing games and even while bringing a basic app from background to the front. Camera is obviously not worth it nor is the sound. Very cleverly they have kept the return window as 10 days. This tells us that they themselves are not confident about their products",1
All are the good..best phone.,5
First time OnePlus user. Good battery n gaming speed n other functions. But need to work on camera as compared to Samsung.,5
Very fast phone,3
Super fast,5
Hang problem,4
All the way worth for your price.,4
Phone is very good but wrong advertising is done as they say that sandstone case worth Rs. 990 is free but when you buy phone with exchange you will not be able to add sandstone case in cart and hence cannot get the case free.,5
Nice product,4
"Completely disappointed by its camera quality. I expected for a great quality with crisp . 2 cameras hahaha. It's just a gimmick I think. Mirrorfie compared with my old one moto G4 plus - surprisingly G4 won. Selfies are a lil bit good.
Coming to performance, 6gigs of RAM what's the use. Asphalt 9 was crashed since the beginning of usage. Totally pathetic. Recents also reloading all the time. It's hanging after usage of 1 month. What a mobile at 35k. Well done OnePlus.",3
Good,5

‚ù§Ô∏è,5
Best smartphone overall. You will love holding this master piece in your hand.,5
"Awesome Mobiles..
Software stabilization requires much more
But it's worth for money...
Picture Quality is pretty good
Sound is not good, it's not sterio speakers...
In loud speakers song getting vibrated..
Battery life about 8 to 10 hours... But its dependent the usage too",5
Grt phone,5
